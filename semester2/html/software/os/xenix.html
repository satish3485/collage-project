				<h2>The origin of XENIX</h2>

				<p> XENIX is Microsoft's version of the 
				<a href="../../software/os/unix.html">UNIX</a> operating system which they made 
				    in 1980, after UNIX was made available outside 
				    <a href="../../software/companies_people/bell.html">Bell Labs</a>. 
				    Since, AT&amp;T
				    did not permit Microsoft to use the name UNIX for its version of the
				    <a href="../../software/os/os.html">operating system</a>, Microsoft 
				    changed the name slightly and called it XENIX.</p>
				    
				    <p>XENIX, like UNIX, was a portable operating system and was made to 
				    run on the DEC PDP-11, the <a href="../../hardware/intel_8085_8086.html">Intel 8086</a>, Zilog Z8000
				    and the Motorola M68000. Since XENIX was based on UNIX, 
				    <a href="../../software/companies_people/microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>
				    was able to make UNIX software compatible on the XENIX OS as well.
				    Also historically, changes in the development of UNIX had an indirect
				    impact on the rise and fall of XENIX. </p>

					<h2>Microsoft and SCO</h2>
				<p>The Santa Cruz Operation, Incorporated (SCO) was founded in 1979 as a
				UNIX porting company. In the early 1980's, SCO and Microsoft worked
				together to make produce XENIX and it was a commercial success due to 
				its multi-user capabilities. During this time, competition between UNIX-like 
				operating systems was beginning to rise, resulting in different versions
				of XENIX being released.
				<br>
				 In 1983, SCO made XENIX based on the UNIX System III
				and it also had some additional enhancements from other UNIX-like 
				operating systems such as BSD. Two years later, SCO produced the XENIX 286,
				which was adapted for the Intel 286 based on the UNIX System V. </p>
				
				<p>During this time, AT&amp;T and Bell Labs split and sold UNIX.
				This had a direct impact on XENIX, as Microsoft thought that the
				competition was getting too high in this market and sold XENIX to SCO.
				Thus in 1987, SCO produced the SCO XENIX 386, which supported Intel 386 
				processors and two years later, in 1989, the SCO UNIX was produced based 
				on System. However, by 1991, many other UNIX-like operating systems were
				being developed (such as Linux) and SCO produced its last SCO XENIX 
				during that year.</p>
