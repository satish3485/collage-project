				<h2>The Macintosh Project</h2>
			
				<p> In 1979, Jef Raskin wanted to develop a low cost computer that was
				 easier to use for the common man and thus initialised the Macintosh
				 project. <a href="../../hardware/Steve_Jobs.html">Steve Jobs </a>
				 revolutionised the idea of the operating system for
				 the Macintosh when he took charge of the project in 1981.
				 At the time, the Graphical user interface (<a href="../../software/os/gui.html">GUI</a>) 
				 technology was being
				 developed in the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) for the 
				 <a href="../../hardware/Xerox_alto.html">XEROX Alto</a>.
				 Jobs offered XEROX, a share of Apple and in return was allowed to use GUI 
				 for the Macintosh Personal Computer. Apple created some new features for 
				 the GUI to be used in the <a href="../../hardware/macintosh128k_hw.html">Macintosh PC</a>, 
				 such as the menu-bar and developed 
				 the idea of being able to drag and drop files to move them which are key
				 features that remain in Macs even to this day.
				 </p> 
				 <h2>The System &amp; The Finder</h2>
				 
				<a href="#6"><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width: 40%">
				<img class="captionedImg" src="images/mac_desktop.png" alt="GUI in the First Macintosh PC">
				<div class="caption">GUI in the First Macintosh PC</div>
				</div></a>
				
				<p> The System
				 Software, also known as the System was the 
				 <a href="../../software/os/os.html">operating system</a> used by the
				 Macintosh PC when it was first released in 1984. Before, joining the 
				 Macintosh Project, Steve Jobs was involved in the 
				 <a href="../../hardware/apple_lisa.html">Apple Lisa</a> project and
				 some features of the System Software were inspired from the Lisa 
				 operating system. 
				 </p>
				 <p> The main reason behind the rapid popularity of the System was that
				 unlike other operating systems at the time which used a command line 
				 interface, it was completely based on GUI. The Finder was another feature 
				 of the Macintosh which was not seen before in Personal Computers.  The 
				 Finder was basically an application used for file management and displayed
				 the desktop.
				 </p>
				 <h2>Development of the Operating System</h2>
				 <!-- CHANGE THE NUMBER IN THE <sup></sup> TAGS EACH TIME -->
				 <p> When it was first released in 1984, the System used a flat file system
				 where all files would be saved under one single directory. This was a chaotic
				 way of storing files, and in 1985, A second version of the System was
				 released which used a Hierarchical File System, which used the tree 
				 structure to organise files in directories. It should be noted, that at
				 this time, the System and Finder were being developed and versioned separately,
				 so in 1985, the Finder was already at version 4, and now included the 
				 Mini Finder, used to quickly launch applications.</p>
				 
				 <p> In 1987, the System 5 was released and it now included the  Multifinder,
				 which allowed users to run several programs at once. At this time, the Finder 
				 and the System were still being versioned seperately, and it was getting 
				 difficult to remember the right version number for the System and Finder. 
				 Therefore, in 1988 the first version of the operating system was provided
				  where a single version number was provided for both the System and the 
				  Finder (Version 6). Finally in 1991, the System was renamed as the Mac OS, 
				  and this is the way the operating system is called to date.
