				<p>BIOS stands for the Basic Input/Output System found in Windows computers
				and unlike operating systems, it is integrated into the computer (i.e.
				users do not have to install it). The BIOS is the first application to be launched 
				when the computer starts up and follows a series of steps to check whether
				all the hardware is functioning properly before loading the 
				<a href="../../software/os/os.html">operating system</a>.
				 The very first step is to conduct a power on self test (POST)
				immediately after the computer is turned on, whereby the BIOS checks the
				CPU registers, the main memory, itself etc and identifies the devices
				that need to be booted.</p>
				
				<p> In later versions, the BIOS is able to also
				organise and select which devices needed to be started. After completing
				the POST, the BIOS is responsible for starting up (initialising) all the 
				major hardware, such as the CPU and the RAM. The BIOS then passes control
				over to the operating system of the computer. Unlike operating systems,
				BIOS is stored on the motherboard as Read Only Memory (ROM). Later,
				as the hardware of computers developed further, BIOS was stored on 
				the Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), the 
				first versions of which were used in 1978 for the Intel 2816. </p>
			
				
				<p>The term BIOS was first used in 1975, by Gary Kildall and was used to 
				depict the part of a computer's hardware that was initialised when the
				computer was turned on and the operating system was loaded. </p>

				<p>A Read Only Memory (ROM) chip is defined as a non-volatile method of
				storage in a computer as it doe not require power all the time to 
				retain information, unlike the RAM, where once the computer is
				disconnected from its power source, the data stored in the RAM is lost.
				However, writing data to ROM was a slower process than writing to RAM
				and ROM chips could only store a fraction of the amount of data that RAM 
				chips could. Hence, the development of BIOS is heavily reliant on the
				development of Processors at the time. In 1974, the <a href="../../hardware/intel_8008_8080.html">Intel 8080</a>,
				had an Addressable Memory of 64 Kilobytes. The amount that could be stored
				on a ROM chip at the time was much less. But within a decade, a rapid 
				growth in hardware development, allowed Processors to store more data in
				memory (by 1985, the Intel 80386 had an addressable memory of 4 Gigabytes).
				As a result, the capacity of the ROM chip also increased.
