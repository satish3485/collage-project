				<h1>Graphical User Interface</h1>
				
				<h2>Xerox Alto</h2>
				
				<a href="#1"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 20%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/alto.jpg" alt="the Xerox Alto"><div class="caption">the Xerox Alto</div></div></a>
				
				
				<p>
				Completed in 1973, one of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center's (<a href="../../internet/xerox_parc.html">PARC</a>) first products was the <a href="../../hardware/Xerox_alto.html">Xerox Alto</a>. It was the <b>first computer to have a mouse and a graphical user interface</b> (GUI), inspired by <a href="../companies_people/Douglas_Engelbart.html">Engelbart</a>'s oN-Line System.</p>
				<p>
				The display had the same size and orientation of
				a normal sheet of paper, and used a grid of bitmapped
				pixels for the display. The graphical component only had
				boxes and text as elements and it used <b>Bravo</b>, a software
				developed to show different kinds of fonts and text
				sizes on the display.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The Alto was never sold to the public. However, Xerox started selling the <b>Xerox Star</b> in
				1981, which had a
				lot in common with the Alto.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Apple Lisa and Macintosh</h2>
				
				<a href="#2"><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width: 25%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/lisa.png" alt="the Lisa Office System"><div class="caption">the Lisa Office System</div></div></a>	
								
				<p>
				Inspired by the work of PARC engineers, <b>Apple</b> 
				decided to create its own GUI. In 1983, the <a href="./apple_lisa.html">Apple Lisa</a>
				was brought to the market. It had a lot in common with the Xerox
				Alto, but it implemented other functions, like
				icons, which were missing in the Xerox, a single button
				mouse which utilised a double click to open
				applications, and the click and drag.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1984, the <a href="../../hardware/macintosh128k_hw.html">Macintosh</a> successfully
				hit the market. It wasn't the first computer to have a graphical user
				interface, but it was much cheaper than its competitors. The
				arrival of <a href="../../software/os/programs.html">Aldus PageMaker</a> for the Macintosh in 1986 and
				the color displays of the Macintosh II amplified the
				success of Apple's products.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Graphical Environment Manager</h2>
				
				
				<a href="#3"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 30%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/gem.png" alt="GEM version 1.1"><div class="caption">GEM version 1.1</div></div></a>	

				
				<p>
				Created by <b>Digital Research Inc.</b> (DRI), the <b>GEM</b> (Graphical Environmental Manager) was the
				successor of the <b>GSX</b>, a graphic library whose purpose
				was to allow graphic applications to run on different
				machines that supported it. It was supposed to be a program that enabled a complete graphical user interface on personal computers.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The first version of the GEM, GEM desktop 1.0, came to
				the market in 1985. It was compatible with <b>CGA</b> and <b>EGA</b>
				displays, and for some machines an <b>8-bit color</b> version
				was also available. It was only supposed to
				work on <a href="../../hardware/ibm_1970s_hw.html">IBM machines</a>, but
				due to numerous complaints, this limitation was soon removed. 
				Not much time later, Apple sued DRI because of the strong similarities
				between GEM and the Apple products (namely Lisa and
				Macintosh).
				</p>
				<p>
				As an answer to Apple, in 1986 the second
				version was released, called GEM desktop 2.0. This version had
				graphical differences compared to the older version, meant to
				solve similarity issues with its
				competitors. This version also had other
				improvements, like bug fixes and the addition of <b>VGA</b> to
				the list of compatible displays. The last commercial
				version of GEM, 3.0, came out in 1988, bringing some
				pre-included applications and a general performance
				upgrade.
