				<h2>VisiCalc</h2>
				
				<a href="#1"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 35%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/visicalc.png" alt="VisiCalc on Apple II"><div class="caption">VisiCalc on Apple II</div></div></a>
				
				<p>
				VisiCalc, initially called "Calcu-ledger", was invented
				by Dan Bricklin in 1978. It was in those year, when he
				was still a student at the Harvard Business School, that he
				thought about creating a new way to do calculations: he
				wanted to build something like a calculator which could
				be controlled using a mouse and a keyboard. He wrote a
				first working prototype on an <a href="../../hardware/Apple_II.html">Apple II</a>, using Apple
				Basic. It was simple and it couldn't do much, but it
				worked. He kept on working on VisiCalc with the help of
				his friend Bob Frankston, and not much time later they
				founded together Software Arts.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				 The first version of the program was released in 1979.
				 At the time there were other similar programs, but
				 their product offered a completely new kind of
				 interaction, and it also run on personal computers.
				 After some problems with memory size, solved when the
				 more powerful Apple II 48k came out, the distribution
				 of the program started thanks to Personal Software,
				 which at the time was one of the biggest software
				 publisher for personal computers. The software was a
				 huge success, thanks to its simple interface and its
				 revolutionary concept. Since at first it was only
				 available for the Apple II, a lot of people ended up
				 buying the machine only to be able to use VisiCalc,
				 which became one of the first killer applications ever.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				 In the following years the program was ported to many
				 different machines, like the <a href="../../hardware/Commodore_PET.html">Commodore PET</a>
				 and the <a href="../../hardware/ibm_1970s_hw.html">IBM PC</a>. Although not all the ports were as good
				 as the original version, they were good enough to boost
				 the sales of those machines. In those years some
				 competitors appeared: while those programs were actually better than
				 VisiCalc, Software Arts' product was still preferred,
				 thanks to the fame it gained in those years. The
				 problems came when Lotus 1-2-3 was released. Written by
				 <a href="../companies_people/Jonathan_Sachs.html">Jonathan Sachs</a>, this software offered better
				 performance and was generally better than VisiCalc.
				 Also, Lotus 1-2-3 tried to remain as similar to
				 VisiCalc as possible, imitating its structure and
				 appearance, so that the users could easily go from
				 VisiCalc to Lotus 1-2-3 without really having to learn
				 the new software. Lotus 1-2-3 gained the control of the
				 whole market, and in 1985 Personal Software, now
				 VisiCorp, sold Software Arts to Lotus Development.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Lotus 1-2-3</h2>
				
				<a href="#2"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 35%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/lotus.png" alt="Lotus 1-2-3 release 3.0 on MS-DOS"><div class="caption">Lotus 1-2-3 release 3.0 on MS-DOS</div></div></a>
				
				<p>
				Lotus 1-2-3 was written by <a href="../companies_people/Jonathan_Sachs.html">Jonathan Sachs</a> in 1982, when
				he joined Mitch Kapor, an ex employee of VisiCalc, to
				found Lotus Development Corporation. The name 1-2-3
				indicated that it wasn't just a spreadsheet: it
				also permitted to create charts and it offered simple
				database operations.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1983 their product, Lotus 1-2-3, started to take
				control of the market which used to be dominated by
				VisiCalc. This software was first created in <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C</a> for the
				Apple II: only later it was then rewritten in assembly
				language for the IBM PC. The change of language
				permitted the software to become much faster and more
				efficient than its competitors. The fact that it was
				only available for the PC permitted the software to be
				more well-finished. Thanks to its widespread success,
				Lotus 1-2-3 became the first killer application for the
				personal computer.
				</p>
				<p>
				The slow decline of Lotus 1-2-3 started with the arrival
				of Microsoft Excel, successor of Multiplan. In 1987
				Excel was ported to the personal computer: even though
				it didn't look like a serious competitor, in that period
				Lotus 1-2-3 was having technical issues, with the delay
				of their third version by more than a year. This
				permitted Excel to start gaining ground, becoming more
				and more popular in the personal computer market.
