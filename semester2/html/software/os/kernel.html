				<h1>Kernel</h1>
				
				<h2>RC 4000 Multiprogramming System</h2>
				
				<p>
				The RC 4000 Multiprogramming System was the operating
				system based on a microkernel built appositely for the
				RC 4000 in 1969. When the programmer Per Brinch Hansen was working on
				this machine he came to the conclusion that all the existing
				operating systems were not suited for the RC 4000, and
				thus he decided to create one by himself. The idea was
				to create a simple kernel, called microkernel, whose
				role was only to set into communication the programs
				that composed the system, becoming the core or basis on which
				the actual operating system was going to be built on.
				</p>
				<p>
				While this machine wasn't
				very successful, the idea of the microkernel which acted
				as a communication tool became very popular in those
				years, being implemented by many companies.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Amiga's Exec</h2>


				<p>
				Developed by Commodore International, Amiga OS was
				the operating system implemented in the <a href="../../hardware/Amiga1000_hw.html">Amiga 1000</a>,
				which was released in 1985. The Amiga OS was based on
				Exec, a preemptive <a href="../software_engineering/multitasking.html">multitasking</a> kernel which provided
				many features, like the handling of dynamic shared
				libraries or the possibility to allocate memory.
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 Its job was to schedule all the tasks running on the
				 machine, using a prioritized scheduling which used a
				 round-robin algorithm. It also permitted communication
				 between processes, via message passing. While other
				 competitors have had problems because of the need to
				 copy the messages between different address spaces, the
				 Amiga solved this problem by only having one address
				 space, avoiding  that kind of difficulties. The other
				 operating systems of those years used to run in the
				 supervisor mode. Exec, instead, used to run in user
				 mode: for when the supervisor mode was really needed,
				 there where specific library functions to activate it.
				</p>
				<p>
				The problem of this kernel was that because of its open
				nature, some programs could interrupt multitasking by
				calling certain functions, like Disable() or Forbid(),
				forcing Exec to run only a single task at a time.
				</p>

				<h2>Unix</h2>

				<p>
				In <a href="./unix.html">Unix</a> the operating system was more highly controlled
				by the kernel. Other than scheduling the tasks to avoid
				conflicts, it directly controlled the file system and it
				decided when to run and when to stop programs. To be
				able to do this the kernel had to be organised in a
				different way compared to the one in the Amiga's Exec.
				</p>
				<p>
				In Unix, the kernel had privileges: the user-space and
				the kernel-space were clearly distinguished. Unix
				utilised a different idea of kernel, which was going in
				the opposite direction of what the other kernel
				manufacturers were doing. While most of the companies
				were trying to enlarge kernels as much as possible, Unix
				adopted the idea of a microkernel,  where the easier
				tasks were taken care by small utilities, in contrast
				to its competitors. In a standard situation the Unix
				kernel didn't have many problems. With time, though, new
				devices and functions were implemented, like the mouse
				or the <a href="./gui.html">graphical user interface</a>. Since their microkernel
				wasn't able to take care of these new devices, it was
				decided to move the control of these unorthodox
				functions outside of the kernels range, and leaving the
				microkernel to deal with the more basic functions of Unix.
