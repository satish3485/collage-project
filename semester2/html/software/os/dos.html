				<h1>Disk Operating System</h1>
				
				<h2>86-DOS</h2>
				
				<a href="#1"><div class="imgRightWithCaption"
				style="width: 35%"><img class="captionedImg"
				src="images/86dos.png" alt="a sample of a simulated
				session of 86-DOS"><div class="caption">a sample of a
				simulated session of 86-DOS</div></div></a>
				
				<p>
				The predecessor of MS-DOS, 86-DOS, was developed by
				Seattle Computer Products for their machine based on
				<a href="../../hardware/Intel_8085_8086.html">intel 8086 processors</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				 In 1979, after having built the
				first 8086 microprocessor card, Seattle Computer needed
				a new <a
				href="./os.html">operating system</a>. Digital Research was developing
				the new CP/M 86, which was supposed to be finished
				soon, but, because of the limited amount of 8086
				processors, Seattle Computer were unable to
				send them one of those processors to help with the
				production of the new operating system. Since <a
				href="../companies_people/microsoft.html">Microsoft</a>
				was already developing software for the 8086, Seattle
				Computer helped them with their research, so that they could use Microsoft's software while waiting for the CP/M 86. At the end
				of 1979, the 8086 cards were shipped with a single
				software, Microsoft's Stand-Alone Disk BASIC, which had
				a built-in operating system. The months passed, 
				but there was still no trace of the CP/M-86. For this
				reason, Seattle Computer decided to build themselves the
				operating system they needed, their own DOS.
				</p>
				<p>
				 The first
				version, called Quick and Dirty Operating System because
				of the small amount of time they had to write it, was
				delivered in August 1980. A new version of the 86-DOS
				came out before the end of 1980, and not much time later
				this DOS was bought by Microsoft, which then renamed it MS-DOS.
				</p>
				
				<h2>MS-DOS</h2>
				
				<a href="#2"><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width: 35%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/msdos.png" alt="a command line of MS-DOS"><div class="caption">a command line of MS-DOS</div></div></a>

				
				<p>
				Microsoft licensed its new MS-DOS to other companies to
				use it for their own products. While at first they were
				free to change the name of the DOS, Microsoft soon decided to force those companies to keep the original name, MS-DOS.
				The only exception was <a href="../../hardware/ibm_1970s_hw.html">IBM</a>, which kept on developing its
				own version, PC DOS, to use for its IBM PC. In the
				meantime, CP/M-86 came out, but, because of the difference
				in price (the CP/M-86 costed almost 200 dollars more
				than its competitors), MS-DOS and PC DOS became soon the
				leaders of the market.
				</p>
				<p>
				In version 2.0, which came out in
				March 1983, was added the support of hard disks and
				hierarchical subdirectories. These and other features
				permitted this version to be two times the size of the
				initial release.
				</p>
				<p>
				Microsoft kept updating its operating
				system regularly until the 90s, when it started losing
				importance, being outdated by the new operating
				systems that came out in those years.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Apple DOS</h2>
				
				<a href="#3"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 35%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/applesoft.png" alt="an example of Applesoft BASIC"><div class="caption">an example of Applesoft BASIC</div></div></a>

				
				<p>
				The Apple DOS was created to be used on the <a href="../../hardware/Apple_II.html">Apple II</a>. In
				fact, when the Apple II came out, in 1977, it didn't
				have any operating system. <a href="../../hardware/stephen_Wozniak.html">Stephen Wozniak</a> was trying to
				implement floppy disks on the machine to substitute the
				old cassette storage system, he and his friend Randy
				Wigginton wrote their first disk operating system, even
				though it wasn't really a complete operating system.
				They kept on updating it, though, adding new features
				little by little until, with the release 3.1, the Apple
				DOS was finally made available to the public in 1978.
				</p>
				<p>
				The first version had some problems and bugs, and
				because of this a new version was soon released, which
				didn't have an updated version number. In 1979, version
				3.2 was released, which implemented a new software,
				Applesoft II floating point BASIC, to substitute the old
				Integer BASIC program. This version also had doubled the
				number of different file types, which changed from four
				to eight.
				</p>
				<p>
				Apple DOS 3.3 came out in 1980. This version was a
				general upgrade compared to version 3.2, improving the
				general performance in almost every field. 3.3 was
				however not backwards compatible, at least until Apple
				released a utility to which permitted to move old 3.2
				files to the newer version.
				After this release, Apple DOS lost importance, mainly
				because Apple was already working on its new product,
				the Apple III, which used a different operating system,
				which lead to the decline of the Apple DOS.
