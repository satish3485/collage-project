				<h1>APPLE LISA</h1>
				<!-- CHANGE THE NUMBER IN THE <sup></sup> TAGS EACH TIME -->
				The Lisa hardware, <a href="os.html">operating system</a>, and its set of office applications were designed by Apple to work together to create a powerful document processing workstation.
				<p>The <b>Lisa</b> operating system featured preemptive <a href="../software_engineering/multitasking.html">multitasking</a> and protected memory - extremely advanced features for a personal computer at the time. Partly based on advanced elements from the Apple III SOS operating system released three years earlier, the Lisa also organised its files in hierarchal directories, making the use of large hard drives practical. The <b>Macintosh</b> eventually adopted this disk organisational design as well for its HFS filing system. 
				<br><br>
				Conceptually, the Lisa resembles the <a href="../../hardware/Xerox_alto.html">Xerox Alto</a> in the sense that it was envisioned as an office computing system. Lisa has two main user modes - the Lisa Office System and the Workshop. 
				<br><br>
				The <b>Lisa Office System</b>, released in 1983 by Apple Computers with their Lisa microcomputer, is the <a href="gui.html">GUI</a> environment for end users. It was eventually renamed "7/7" in reference to the seven supplied application programs: LisaWrite, LisaCalc, LisaDraw, LisaGraph, LisaProject, LisaList, and LisaTerminal. The <b>Workshop</b> was a program development environment and was almost entirely text-based, though it used a GUI text editor. </p>
				
				Notably, developed for the Apple Lisa computer, the <b>Lisa project</b> was the first graphical project management software. It was conceived and implemented by <b>Debra Willrett</b> of SoloSoft.
