				<p>The first piece of software was arguably created by <a href="languages/ada.html"> Ada Lovelace </a> in the 19th century, for the planned analytical engine. However, it was never executed.In the late 1970's and early 1980's, a new programing method was being developed. It was known as <a href="languages/languages_paradigms.html">Object Oriented Programming, or OOP</a>. Objects are pieces of data that can be packaged and manipulated by the programmer. Bjarne Stroustroup liked this method and developed extensions to<a href="languages/most_important_pl.html" > C</a> known as "C With Classes." This set of extensions developed into the full-featured language <a href="languages/most_important_pl.html" >C++</a>, which was released in 1983.In software engineering, a software development methodology (also known as a system development methodology, software development life cycle, software development process, software process) is a division of software development work into distinct phases or activities with the intent of better planning and management. It is often considered a subset of the systems development life cycle. The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application
Common methodologies include waterfall, prototyping, iterative and incremental development, spiral development, rapid application development, and extreme programming. Some people consider a life-cycle "model" a more general term for a category of methodologies and a software development "process" a more specific term to refer to a specific process chosen by a specific organisation. 
Cap Gemini SDM, or SDM2 (System Development Methodology) is a software development method developed by the software company PANDATA in the Netherlands in 1970
Methodologies, processes, and frameworks range from specific proscriptive steps that can be used directly by an organisation in day-to-day work, to flexible frameworks that an organisation uses to generate a custom set of steps tailored to the needs of a specific project or group. In some cases a "sponsor" or "maintenance" organisation distributes an official set of documents that describe the process. Specific examples include:
1970s</p>
	<h2>Structured programming since 1969</h2>
<p>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures and for and while loops—in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the goto statement which could lead to "spaghetti code" which is difficult both to follow and to maintain
The structured program theorem provides the theoretical basis of structured programming. It states that three ways of combining programs—sequencing, selection, and iteration—are sufficient to express any computable function.<br>
	•	Cap Gemini SDM, originally from PANDATA, the first English translation was published in 1974. SDM stands for System Development Methodology</p>
Cap Gemini SDM, or SDM2 (System Development Methodology) is a software development method developed by the software company PANDATA in the Netherlands in 1970. The method is a waterfall model divided in seven phases that have a clear start and end. Each phase delivers (sub)products, called milestones. It was used extensively in the Netherlands for ICT projects in the 1980s and 1990s.SDM was developed in 1970 by a company known as PANDATA, now part of Cap Gemini, which itself was created as a joint venture by three Dutch companies: AKZO, Nationale Nederlanden and PTT. The company was founded in order to develop the method and create training materials to propagate the method. It was successful, but was revised in 1987 to standardize and separate the method theory from the more technical aspects used to implement the method. Those aspects were bundled into the process modelling tool called Software Development Workbench (SDW), that was later sold in 2000 to BWise, another Dutch company.

	•	Structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM) from 1980 onwards<br>
	•	1980: Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) evaluate analysis and design methods.<br>
	•	1981: Consultants working for Learmonth & Burchett Management Systems, led by John Hall, chosen to develop SSADM v1.<br>
	•	1982: John Hall and Keith Robinson left to found Model Systems Ltd, LBMS later developed LSDM, their proprietary version.<br>
	•	1983: SSADM made mandatory for all new information system developments<br>
	•	1984: Version 2 of SSADM released<br>
	•	1986: Version 3 of SSADM released, adopted by NCC<br>
	•	1988: SSADM Certificate of Proficiency launched, SSADM promoted as ‘open’ standard<br>
	•	1989: Moves towards Euromethod, launch of CASE products certification scheme<br>
	•	Information Requirement Analysis/Soft systems methodology<br>
<h2>Soft systems methodology (SSM)</h2>
Soft systems methodology (SSM) is a systemic approach for tackling real-world problematic situations.Soft Systems Methodology is the result of the continuing action research that Peter Checkland, Brian Wilson, and many others have conducted over 30 years, to provide a framework for users to deal with the kind of messy problem situations that lack a formal problem definition<br>

Several software development approaches have been used since the origin of information technology, in two main categories. Typically an approach or a combination of approaches is chosen by management or a development team.
The waterfall model is a sequential development approach, in which development is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through several phases, typically:<br>
	•	Requirements analysis resulting in a software requirements specification<br>
	•	Software design<br>
	•	Implementation<br>
	•	Testing<br>
	•	Integration, if there are multiple subsystems<br>
	•	Deployment (or Installation)<br>
	•	Maintenance<br>
The first formal description of the method is often cited as an article published by Winston W. Royce in 1970 although Royce did not use the term "waterfall".
