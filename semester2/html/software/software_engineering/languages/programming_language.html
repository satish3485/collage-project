				<h1>What is a programming language?</h1>
								
					<p>A <b>programming language</b> is a set of grammatical and semantic rules used to communicate with a computer or a machine. 
					A programming language is used to create programs, which are a set of instructions that control the behavior of a computer. They can also be used to express <b>algorithms</b><a href="#algorithm"><sup>1</sup></a>, which is basically a set of finite instructions, which solve a particular problem. </p>
					<p>Unlike <b>natural languages</b>, such as English, programming languages cannot be ambiguous because computers are not able to make choices in case of ambiguity.</p>
					<p>There are many programming languages, which are applied differently to create software. Thus, programming languages are also used to solve problems, because the process of creating <b>software</b><a href="#software"><sup>2</sup></a> is mainly the process of analyzing and solving a problem.</p>
					<p>A <a href="languages_paradigms.html">programming paradigm</a> is a fundamental style of programming, or way of building and creating the structure of a computer program. 
					There exist many programming paradigms, such as structured programming, functional programming, imperative programming, and object-oriented programming. 
					Consequently, the study of these paradigms is very important in software engineering<a href="#software_engineering"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
					<p>When we talk about programming languages, we usually refer to <b>high-level programming languages</b>, such as <a href="most_important_pl.html#C">C</a>, and not the language that computers really understand, which is a sequence of 1s and 0s. 
					Programs written with high-level programming languages first have to be translated to the machine language in order to be executed by the CPU<a href="#cpu"><sup>4</sup></a>. 
					There are essentially 2 types of translation: <b>compilation</b><a href="#compilation"><sup>5</sup></a> and <b>interpretation</b><a href="#interpretation"><sup>6</sup></a>. 
					Compilation is usually done through the use of a program called a <b>compiler</b>, which usually directly translates the source code<a href="#source_code"><sup>7</sup></a> to the machine language<a href="#machine_code"><sup>8</sup></a>. 
					The main actor in interpretation is the <b>interpreter</b>, which reads and executes the program instruction by instruction.</p> 				
					<p>Languages that are similar to the way a computer works are called <b>low-level programming languages</b><a href="#low"><sup>9</sup></a>.
					Languages that are similar the way the humans think are called high-level programming languages<a href="#high"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
					<p>Programming languages can be used as a tool to create software in many domain areas, such as system programming, 
<<<<<<< HEAD
					desktop applications programming, web applications programming, games programming and mobile programming.</p>
					<p>Having explored the concept of programming languages, we can talk about the <a href="languages_evolution.html">evolution of programming languages</a> and the impact they have had on software from the 70s to the 90s.</p>
					<p>If you are interested in an introduction to programming and programming languages, take a look at the video below.</p>
