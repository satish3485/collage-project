				</div>
					
					<p>One of the most important and influential programming languages invented at the beginning of the 70s is the C<a href="#c"><sup>1</sup></a> 
					general-purpose compiled programming language designed by <a href="../../companies_people/ritchie.html">Dennis Ritchie</a> 
					between 1969 and 1973 at <a href="../../companies_people/bell.html">AT&amp;T Bell Labs</a>. 
					A general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used in a wide variety of applications areas.</p> 
					<p>The creation of C is strictly related to the creation and implementation of the <a href="../../os/unix.html">Unix</a> operating system, 
					which was initially created by Dennis Ritchie and <a href="../../companies_people/thompson.html">Ken Thompson</a>, and a few other programmers. 
					C is an imperative, procedural programming language, but it also allows structured programming.</p>
					<p>Although C is a general-purpose<a href="#general"><sup>2</sup></a> language, 
					it was mainly thought as a system programming language, which means that it was thought to create system software, 
					such as operating systems or drivers.</p>
					<p>The language derived mostly from the type-less language BCPL<a href="#bcpl"><sup>3</sup></a> 
					and the B<a href="#b"><sup>4</sup></a> programming language, written previously by Ken Thompson in 1970 at Bell Labs.</p>
					<p>It was static typed to prevent unwanted operations, and it allowed recursion and dynamic memory allocation.
					<p>The C programming language influenced many other programming languages, such as C++, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python or Java.</p>
					<p>1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)<a href="#ansi"><sup>5</sup></a> 
					decided to put together a committee to define a standard definition of the language. 
					The definition ended around 1988, and it was called ANSI C<a href="#ansi_c"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
				
				<h4>Pascal</h4>
					<p>In 1970, another important imperative and procedural programming language that was emerging is the Pascal<a href="#pascal"><sup>7</sup></a> programming language 
					designed by Niklaus Wirth<a href="#niklaus"><sup>8</sup></a>, a member of the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP)<a href="#ifip"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
					<p>Pascal was created as a small and efficient language invented to encourage good programming practices 
					using the <a href="languages_paradigms.html#Structured">structured programming</a> and data structuring<a href="#ds"><sup>10</sup></a>, which refers to particular and efficient ways of organizing data in a computer. 
					It was also developed as a vehicle for the teaching of the important concepts of computer programming.</p>

				<h4><a id="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a></h4>
					<p>Around 1972, an insurgent programming language named <b>Smalltalk</b><a href="#smalltalk"><sup>11</sup></a> came out. 
					Smalltalk was designed as a graphical programming language but it rapidly became a complete integrated programming environment with a debugger, an object-oriented virtual memory, an editor, a screen manager and a user interface. It was also created in part for educational purposes, at the Learning Research Group (LRG) of Xerox PARC<a href="#parc"><sup>12</sup></a> 
					by <a href="../../companies_people/kay.html">Alan Kay</a>, Dan Ingalls<a href="#ingalls"><sup>13</sup></a>, Adele Goldberg<a href="#goldberg"><sup>14</sup></a>, 
					Ted Kaehler<a href="#kaehler"><sup>15</sup></a>, Scott Wallace. It is an <a href="languages_paradigms.html#OOP">object-oriented</a>, 
					dynamically-typed<a href="#dynamic_typed"><sup>16</sup></a> and reflective<a href="#reflection"><sup>17</sup></a> programming language. 
					It was not the first object-oriented language, but it has been one of the most influential object-oriented programming languages and it is the first dynamic object-oriented programming language</p>
					<p>It is thought that the first actual object-oriented programming language was Simula 67<a href="#simula67"><sup>18</sup></a>, 
					which has been influencing all the following object-oriented languages, such as Smalltalk or C++.</p>
					<p>Smalltalk was originally used to create prototypes of simpler programming languages 
					and graphical interfaces (GUIs)<a href="#gui"><sup>19</sup></a>. 
					Smalltalk was first run on Xeroxâ€™s Alto computer<a href="#xerox_alto_computer"><sup>20</sup></a>, 
					which was designed for it.</p>			
		
				<h4><a id="Prolog">Prolog</a></h4>
					<p>Between 1972 and 1973, another general purpose and one of the first logic programming languages appeared, 
					Prolog<a href="#prolog"><sup>21</sup></a>. It was originally thought as a natural language processing, 
					which is field of computer science, artificial intelligence<a href="#ai"><sup>22</sup></a>, 
					and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human natural languages. 
					Prolog represented a fundamental new approach to computing, 
					and it became a serious competitor to LISP<a href="#lisp"><sup>23</sup></a>.</p>
					<p>The language was first conceived by a group around Alain Colmerauer<a href="#colmerauer"><sup>24</sup></a>, 
					Roussel, and Kowalski, in Marseille, France.</p>
				
				<h4><a id="ML">ML</a></h4>			
					<p>In 1974, Robin Milner<a href="#rm"><sup>25</sup></a> with other collaborators invented the functional ML<a href="#ml"><sup>26</sup></a> programming language. 
					It was designed as the implementation language for LCF<a href="#lcf"><sup>27</sup></a> theorem prover. 
					It was strongly typed, it supported parametric polymorphism<a href="#poly"><sup>28</sup></a> and type inference<a href="#t_inference"><sup>29</sup></a>. 
					This language has also evolved in different dialects over the following years.</p>
				
				<h4>Scheme</h4>
					<p>Scheme<a href="#scheme"><sup>30</sup></a> was created as another dialect of the older programming language Lisp by Guy L. Steele<a href="#steele"><sup>31</sup></a> 
					and Gerald Jay Sussman<a href="#sussman"><sup>32</sup></a>, around 1975. It was developed at the MIT Al Lab<a href="#mit_al_lab"><sup>33</sup></a>, 
					mostly for the academic world via a series of memos. 
					It was t=he first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope<a href="#lexical_scope"><sup>34</sup></a> 
					and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call<a href="#tail_call"><sup>35</sup></a> optimization, 
					giving stronger support for functional programming<a href="#functional"><sup>36</sup></a> 
					and associated techniques such as recursive<a href="#recursion"><sup>37</sup></a> algorithms. 
					It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class<a href="#first_class"><sup>38</sup></a> continuations. 
					It had a significant influence on the development of Common Lisp, the other main dialect of the List programming language.</p>
				
				<h4><a id="SQL">SQL</a></h4>
					<p>A special purpose, <a href="languages_paradigms.html#Declarative">declarative</a> 
					and procedural programming language that came out around 1974 was SQL<a href="#sql"><sup>39</sup></a> or structured query language. 
					SQL was initially developed at IBM<a href="#ibm"><sup>40</sup></a> by Donal D. Chamberlin<a href="#chamberlin"><sup>41</sup></a> 
					and Raymond F. Boyce. 
					It was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, 
					System R<a href="#system_r"><sup>42</sup></a>, 
					which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.</p>
					<p>The original name SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because SEQUEL was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley aircraft company. </p>
					<p>In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc., 
					which is now called Oracle Corporation<a href="#oracle"><sup>43</sup></a> saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd (a pioneer of the relational model for databases), 
					Chamberlin, and Boyce and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS<a href="#rdbms"><sup>44</sup></a> or relation database management system 
					with the intention of selling it to the U.S. Navy, Central Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. Government agencies.</p>
