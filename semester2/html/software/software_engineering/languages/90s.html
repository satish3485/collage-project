				<h2><a id="1990">Programming languages of the early 90s</a></h2>
				
					<h4><a id="Perl">Perl</a></h4>
						<p>One of the first web programming languages was Perl<a href="#perl"><sup>1</sup></a>, 
						which was characterized by the wide variety of text processing facilities, 
						regular expression<a href="#re"><sup>2</sup></a> 
						and binary data streams<a href="#bin"><sup>3</sup></a> support. It was interpreted and dynamic. 
						Perl was initially created by Larry Wall<a href="#wall"><sup>4</sup></a> in 1987 at Unisys, 
						but it has evolved in a family of languages over the following years.</p>
						<p>Its founder, before creating it, had already created other compilers. 
						The ideas from those experiences and other languages constructs were put together when creating Perl:</p>

					<h4><a id="Python">Python</a></h4>
						<p>The idea of creating Python<a href="#python"><sup>5</sup></a> goes back to 1980s, 
						but its implementation was just started in 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands. 
						It was a successor of the ABC<a href="#abc"><sup>6</sup></a> programming language, and the first interpreter for that language was written by Guido.</p>
						<p>This is more or less the initial idea and the premises of the creation of the Python programming language according to its creator:</p>
						<p><i>Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. 
						My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer and not much else on my hands. 
						I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: 
						a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, 
						being in a slightly irreverent mood and a big fan of Monthy Python.</i></p>

						<p>The Hypertext Markup Language or HTML<a href="#html"><sup>7</sup></a> was invented by the physicist Tee Berners Lee at CERN, 
						where the World Wide Web (WWW)<a href="#w3c"><sup>8</sup></a> began its life, 
						as language for sharing data between scientists, and subsequently it became the official language for structuring webpages.</p>

					<h4><a id="Oak">Oak</a></h4>
						<p>In 1991, <a href="../../companies_people/vanrossum_goslings.html">James Gosling</a>, 
						Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton started developing a new compiled-interpreted programming language called Oak<a href="#oak"><sup>9</sup></a>. 
						This language was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for that purpose. 
						It was also thought to have as few implementation dependencies as possible; 
						it was thought to be cross-platform through the use of a virtual machine. 
						This language was first implemented in C and C++. Later, Oak was renamed to Java, 
						that would have become one of the most used languages ever.</p>
