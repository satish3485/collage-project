				<h2><a id="1980">Programming languages of the 80s</a></h2>
				
					<h4><a id="C++">C++</a></h4>
					
						<p>In 1979, the Danish and British <a href="../../companies_people/Bjarne_Stroustrup.html">Bjarne Stroustrup</a> started developing the compiled object-oriented, 
						imperative and generic C++<a href="#cpp"><sup>1</sup></a> programming language at Bell Labs. 
						The intention of the creator of C++ was to put together the efficiency and the flexibility of the C programming language 
						and high level features for a better and well-organized software production, such as classes of the Simula 67. 
						The language was also influenced by other programming languages, 
						such as ALGO 68<a href="#algo68"><sup>2</sup></a>, Ada or ML. </p>
						<p>C++ was conceived to be strongly typed, and it started supporting many features, 
						such as default arguments<a href="#default_args"><sup>3</sup></a> in functions, 
						virtual functions<a href="#virtual_func"><sup>4</sup></a>, operator overloading<a href="#operator_overloading"><sup>5</sup></a>, 
						references<a href="#reference"><sup>6</sup></a>, 
						constants<a href="#constant"><sup>7</sup></a>, dynamic memory allocation<a href="#dynamic_mem"><sup>8</sup></a> 
						(with the "new" and the "delete" constructs), single-line comments with two forward slashes (//), 
						multiple inheritance<a href="#multiple_inheritance"><sup>9</sup></a> 
						or exception handling<a href="#exception"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
						<p>The language was first called by its creator as “C with classes", 
						but the name changed to C++ to emphasize the evolutionary nature of the changes from C, 
						or the addition of new functionality respect to other languages, 
						since the ++ symbol, in the C programming language, is the increment operator.</p>
						<p>Bjarne Stroustrup wanted also to maintain as much as possible backward compatibility with C libraries and modules, 
						that’s why many "dangerous" features of the C programming language were removed.</p>
						<p>C++ has evolved over those years, but without an official version until the late 1990s, 
						but in many versions, which corresponded also to different version of compilers and libraries.</p>
						<p>The first real C++ compiler, written by Bjarne Stroustrup, 
						was an ancestor version of CFront<a href="#cfront"><sup>11</sup></a>, 
						and it was not written in C++, but in C. 
						The new compiler was used to compile the “C with classes” code to C, 
						and then this new language “C with classes” was used to create a more efficient CFront compiler. 
						The new compiler was written in “C with classes”, 
						because writing it with C would have required much more time and effort.</p>
						
						<p>This is the controvert explanation of its creator:</p>

						<p><i>The first C++ compiler (CFront) was written in C++. 
						To build that, I first used C to write a "C with Classes"-to-C preprocessor.
						 "C with Classes'' was a C dialect that became the immediate ancestor to C++. 
						 That preprocessor translated "C with Classes" constructs (such as classes and constructors) into C. 
						 It was a traditional preprocessor that didn't understand all of the language, 
						 left most of the type checking for the C compiler to do, 
						 and translated individual constructs without complete knowledge. 
						 I then wrote the first version of CFront in "C with Classes".</i></p>
						
						<p>Why Bjarne Stroustrup created C++?</p>

                        <div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width:200px;"><a href="#logo"><img class="captionedImg" src="../images/ada_logo.png" alt="Ada Logo"><div class="caption">Ada Logo</div></a></div>
                        <p>Ada was developed by Jean Ichbiah<a href="#jean"><sup>12</sup></a> from 1977 to 1983 to satisfy the exigencies of United States Department of Defense (DoD)<a href="#usdof"><sup>13</sup></a> that at current time used a lot of other different programming languages.</p>
                        <p>After its revision in early 90s (version called Ada 95) it became the first programming language to be internationally standardized (ISO) as Object-Oriented Language. The language was called like that in honor of Augusta Ada Lovelace<a href="#ada"><sup>14</sup></a>, a mathematician who, because of her work with Charles Babbage<a href="#babbage"><sup>15</sup></a>, is sometimes regarded as the world’s first programmer.
                        <p>Ada is principally employed as a language needed in high-integrity, safety-critical or high-security camps including commercial and military aircraft avionics, air traffic control, railroad systems, and medical devices. For example, the fly by wire system software in the Boeing 777 was written in Ada. It is also a quite good teaching purpose language: used worldwide in major universities is proficient at both introductory and advanced computer science courses.<a href="#core"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

					
					<h4><a id="MatLab">MatLab</a></h4>
					
						<p>A numerical computing environment and its programming language, MatLab<a href="#matlab"><sup>18</sup></a>, 
						which stands for matrix laboratory, was first developed by Cleve Moler<a href="#moler"><sup>19</sup></a> at the University of New Mexico, around 1970s. 
						He designed it to give his student’s access to LINPACK<a href="#linpack"><sup>20</sup></a> and EISPACK<a href="#eispack"><sup>21</sup></a>, 
						both software libraries for algebra and numerical computing. </p>
						<p>Subsequently, around the 1984, MatLab was rewritten by the programmers of MathWorks, 
						that in the meantime had enrolled Cleve Moler as their dependent, using the C programming language.</p>
						<p>By Cleve Moler about the creation of MatLab:</p>
						
						<p><i>When we were developing EISPACK and LINPACK, 
						I was a math professor at the University of New Mexico, 
						teaching numerical analysis and matrix theory. 
						I wanted my students to be able to use our new packages without writing Fortran programs, 
						so I studied a book by Niklaus Wirth to learn about parsing computer languages.</i></p>	
									
						<p>This new language and environment allows matrix manipulations, 
						plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, 
						creation of user interfaces and can also interact with other programming languages, such as C++.</p>
						
						<p>MatLab was revolutionary because it was not invented just for computer scientist, but for all scientist.</p>
