				<h1>Free software</h1>
				<p>The term <q>free software</q> refers to software that gives the user 
				the freedom to run the software for any purpose as well as to study,
				modify, and distribute the original software and any adapted versions.
				Though the name would be <q>officially</q> coined only in 1983, forms of
				distribution and communities comparable to the free software community
				already existed long before the birth of the movement. For all its early
				history, software had mostly been distributed and shared freely by 
				researchers (the only people to use computers at the time). This was not
				necessarily for ethical reasons, but mostly because it was used and made
				by scientists to do research, rather than sold by companies to make money;
				and because software was often distributed with or as source code, often 
				coming with the machine itself.</p>
				<h2>Early decline</h2>
				<p>By the early 70s, free software was in decline. Due to the increasing 
				complexity of operating systems and language compilers, the production
				cost of software had steadily increased over the previous decades. This 
				brought to the emergence of software companies and the software industry, 
				now increasingly disjoint from the hardware industry, and the decline of
				software bundled with hardware.</p>
				<p>Though some software continued to be freely distributed and developed
				during the decade (in 1978 
				<a href="../companies_people/knuth.html">Donald Knuth</a> released 
				<a href="../os/programs.html">TeX</a>, 
				for example), licenses grew in numbers and restrictiveness, and copyright
				was enforced with increasing zeal. It was in 1976 that
				<a href="../companies_people/bill_gates.html">Bill Gates</a> published
				his <q>Open Letter to Hobbyists</q>, complaining about the unauthorised
				sharing of a pre-release copy of
				<a href="../companies_people/microsoft.html">Microsoft's</a>
				BASIC interpreter.</p>
				<h2>The advent of the internet</h2>
				<p>During the 70s and early 80s free software had continued to be
				distributed as source code, mostly via magazines, books and tapes (notably 
				the DECUS tapes). People even copied source code by hand from
				books and newspapers. However, with the advent of 
				<a href="../../internet/usenet.html">Usenet</a> and UUCPNet, a new 
				and convenient way of distributing software was born: the 
				<a href="../../internet/index.html">internet</a>.
				This not only made sharing easier but also allowed for increased
				cooperation within the community.</p>
				<h2>The free software movement</h2>

				<p>In 1983, Richard Stallman, a computer programmer, launched the GNU
				Project, formally founding the free-software movement and coining the term
				<q>free software</q>. The GNU Project<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
				(GNU stands for GNU's Not <a href="../os/unix.html">Unix</a>) aim 
				was to create a complete Unix-like operating system, whose source code
				would be freely available and modifiable by the users. Stallman had come 
				to this decision after several incidents, including one in which he and
				his colleagues were unable to fix their printer, because its driver's
				source code was publicly unavailable, restricted by licenses.<br>
				Two years later Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, outlining the aims
				of the GNU project, its importance and benefits to computer users, as well
				as answer to specific objection to GNU's goals and philosophy, and
				explaining the free software philosophy.<br>
				In 1985 the Free Software Foundation<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> was founded, with the aim of
				promoting the freedom to study, distribute, create and modify software.<br>
				A year later The Free Software Definition was written by Stallman,
				explaining that the term <q>free</q> in <q>free software</q> is intended
				as in <q>freedom</q> rather than <q>free of charge</q>, and that once
				should be able to change a program, in order to control it, rather than
				being controlled by it: affirming the ethical rather than purely
				economical nature of the idea.<br>
				In the following years a license, the GNU General Public License, was
				developed and released in 1989, as a way to guarantee the rights contained
				in the Free Software Definition to the program recipient.<br>
				Finally, in 1991, Linus Torvalds released the source code for the Linux
				kernel, providing the final piece for the GNU Project.</p>
