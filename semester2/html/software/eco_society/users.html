				<h1>The evolution of users</h1>
				<blockquote>
				<i><q>There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home</q></i>
				<br> - Ken Olsen, co-founder of the Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977
				</blockquote>
				<p>In the years between the 70s and the 90s many things changed in the 
				world of computers. One of these great changes was the users themselves:
				due to the development of different 
				<a href="interaction.html">ways of interacting with software</a> and
				computers, lower prices and the growing usefulness of computers, the
				user demographic evolved in a drastic way.</p>
				<h2>Why would you ever want one?</h2>
				<a href="#1"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 25%">
				<img class="captionedImg" src="images/robot.jpg" alt="Robot">
				<div class="caption">The future, or so they thought</div>
				</div></a>
				<p>In the 70s it was the firm belief of many people that computers had no
				place in anyone's home, they were serious tools for serious matters and
				serious people, like scientists, researchers, and corporations. With the
				release of the first microcomputers, the 
				<a href="../../hardware/Apple_II.html">Apple II</a> and 
				<a href="../../hardware/Commodore_PET.html">Commodore PET</a>, this
				attitude remained, but, slowly, some began to dream of a different future,
				a future with a computer in every home, running software that would take
				care of every detail, and robots to take out the thrash. Computers were
				becoming cheaper, more powerful, and somewhat fashionable.<br>
				The idea of software that would allow mothers to store recipes and connect
				to medical databases to help with childcare, that would allow children to
				play video games, fathers to read personalised newspapers and homes to 
				become <q>intelligent</q>, was spreading, and, consequentially, computers
				started spreading to different audiences, no longer just the scientists
				and enthusiasts of the early days.</p>
				<h2>I told you they were useless</h2>
				<p>Unfortunately for the futuristic dreams of '77, reality ensued: the
				home computers of the late 70s and early 80s were <i>not</i> powerful
				enough to handle dreamy automated houses and they were not particularly
				usable, with at best text-based interfaces and at worst command-line 
				interfaces that required the memorisation of multiple commands. So, after
				the <a href="../../games/videogame_crash.html">video game crash of 1983</a>,
				computers were no longer the fashionable 
				machine of the futuristic man, but at most the toy of quite unfashionable
				<q>nerds</q>, at best the tools of scientists and businesses. The
				home computers purchased in the early optimistic atmosphere were abandoned
				or left as toys for children.<br>
				The user demographic was thus practically returned to its original form:
				scientists, corporations and enthusiasts.</p>
				<h2>Not so useless after all</h2>
				<p>Despite the backlash of the early 80s, computers survived, hardware
				kept becoming cheaper and more powerful, and an ever increasing number
				of businesses and corporations started adopting them. On the software side,
				developments in user interface, like the 
				<a href="../os/gui.html">GUI</a>, had become ubiquitous by the
				late 80s, making computers much more approachable and usable by everyone.
				The advent of the  <a href="../../internet/index.html">Internet</a> also
				made computers much more interesting for the general public. So, in the
				early 90s people started buying computers once again, enticed by the 
				ability to work at home, using the same operating system, usually 
				<a href="../os/dos.html">MS-DOS</a>,
				and <a href="../os/programs.html">programs</a> they used in the office, 
				play games and surf the internet.</p>
				<h2>A steep price</h2>
				<p>Back in the early 70s computers were expensive, machines
				used by scientists, a few businesses and some enthusiast, but by the
				early 90s things had completely changed, computers were more widespread and
				usable and so the user demographic changed too: now a sizeable chunk of
				the user base had no idea about how computers worked, how programs
				were written or what a command-line even was.<br>
				While cheaper hardware was certainly a main driver of this demographic
				shift, GUIs were absolutely key in allowing the average desk worker to
				become the average user. This made computers successful, but it also had
				a steep price: if in the 70s BASIC was the 
				<a href="../software_engineering/languages/programming_language.html"><i>lingua franca</i></a>
				of computers and practically every user knew it, by the early 90s, more
				and more users didn't even know what BASIC was, which would have forced software
				developers to make programs even more usable, and hide away the true nature
				of computers and software.</p>
