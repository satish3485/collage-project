				<h1>Human-computer interaction</h1>
				<p>Practically all of todays' ways of interacting with computers and
				software were developed before or during the period from the 70s and the
				90s, even the touchscreen, the staple of the smartphone era.</p>
				<h2>Command-line interface</h2>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 33%">
				<img class="captionedImg" src="images/bash.jpg" alt="CLI">
				<div class="caption">Bash, an example of CLI</div>
				</div>
				<p>Evolved from earlier forms of controlling computers, the command-line
				interface (CLI) was the prevalent form of interaction with software in
				the 70s, and early 80s, until the widespread introduction of the GUI.<br>
				The command line interface allowed people to interact in a real time
				way with software, by giving written commands to the computer and, with
				interpreters, allowed people to use a programming language, notably BASIC,
				to communicate with their machines. It had become possible thanks to better
				monitor technology, (going from teleprinters that literally printed
				characters on paper to actual monitors).<br>
				This kind of interface required users to memorise a list of commands and
				have some programming knowledge.<br>
				Though completely replaced by GUIs in the mainstream CLIs would continue
				to be used in certain contexts, like programming.</p>
				<h2>Text-based UI</h2>
				<a href="#1"><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width: 33%">
				<img class="captionedImg" src="images/text_ui.jpg" alt="Text-based UI">
				<div class="caption">Text-based UI</div>
				</div></a>
				<p>Text-based interfaces would be a sort of <q>missing link</q> between
				the command-line and the GUI. Still mostly text based they offered a more
				friendly approach to interacting with software. Some of these interfaces
				allowed for the use of a mouse, others would be navigated via keyboard or
				both. Though certainly easier to utilise than CLIs these interfaces did
				not yet allow for the usability level and intuitive metaphors of GUIs.<br>
				Many of the earlier <a href="../os/visicalc_lotus123.html">killer apps</a>
				had text-based interfaces.<br>
				They would be almost completely replaced by GUIs, surviving only in 
				<a href="../os/bios.html">BIOS</a>
				and niche applications, like servers.</p>
				<h2>The mouse</h2>
				<p>Though invented earlier than the 70s (it was shown by 
				<a href="../companies_people/Douglas_Engelbart.html">Douglas Engelbert</a>
				in his famous demo, in 1968) the 
				<a href="../../hardware/mouse.html">mouse</a> 
				would become widespread only later
				on, in the 80s, with PC compatible mouses and mouses being included with
				the <a href="../../hardware/apple_lisa.html">Apple Lisa</a> and
				<a href="../../hardware/macintosh128k_hw.html">Macintosh 128K</a>.<br>
				The mouse will allow for a revolution in software, opening up new ways of
				interacting with it, and leading to modern GUIs.</p>
				<a href="#2"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 33%">
				<img class="captionedImg" src="images/mac_gui.jpg" alt="GUI">
				<div class="caption">Macintosh GUI</div>
				</div></a>
				<h2>The GUI</h2>
				<p>Enabled by the mouse, better monitors and ever more powerful computers,
				<a href="../os/gui.html">GUIs</a> would revolutionise the way people
				interact with software leading to the development of modern metaphors and
				paradigms, like the desktop and  windows. Though it was first developed by
				<a href="../../internet/xerox_parc.html">Xerox PARC</a>, it would be 
				Apple with the Apple Lisa, Macintosh and
				<a href="../companies_people/microsoft.html">Microsoft's</a> imitations
				that would bring the GUI into the mainstream.<br>
				Its characteristics would allow GUIs to make computers and software much
				more usable and approachable by users, even less tech savvy ones.</p>
				<h2>Touchscreens</h2>
				<a href="#3"><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width:29%">
				<img class="captionedImg" src="images/hp_touchscreen.jpg" alt="Touch">
				<div class="caption">HP-150</div>
				</div></a>
				<p>Though imagined already in the late 60s the first touch was realised
				by CERN scientists Frank Beck and Bent Stumpe in 1973. They would have remained
				out of the mainstream computers for another decade, and only in 1983
				a computer with a touchscreen would have been commercialised, the HP-150.<br>
				Those early touchscreens were based on infrared transmitters and sensors
				and did not have the multi-touch capacity of later touchscreens.
				Multi-touch capabilities would be developed in 1982, and in 1985, the
				first tablet was developed.<br>
				Though touchscreens did not greatly influence the computers of the time,
				they would later become ubiquitous.</p>
