<h1>NeXT, Inc.</h1>  
                
<!-- Caratteristiche -->
<p>NeXT, Inc was an American computer company, based in Redwood City, California. NeXT was known for its high standard computers, created mostly for the business markets and for educational purposes.</p>
                
<!-- Storia -->
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1984 <a href='../../hardware/Steve_Jobs.html'>Steve Jobs</a>, co-founder of Apple, was the chief of the <a href='../os/classic_mac.html'>Macintosh</a> and <a href='../os/apple_lisa.html'>Lisa</a> computer projects. One day while discussing with Paul Berg, he suggested to create a "3M" workstation with more than one megabyte of RAM, a megapixel and a megaflop. After some discussions between the members of Apple, Jobs was forced to leave his company.</p>
<p>For this reason Jobs and other Apple's employees decided to create a new company, called Next, Inc.<br> Jobs and his few employees started gathering information about what educational and scientific companies wanted to see from their workstations. At the end of this survey, the result was that the workstations had to be as powerful as possibile, but at the same time they should run without problems and crashes, and cheap enough so that students could buy them.</p>
<h2> First and Second Generation Computers</h2>
<p>In 1986, they decided to start developing their own software and hardware, instead of using components of other companies.</p>
<p> The team was joined by Avie Tevanian, who was working on the Mach kernel, which was being developed to support operating system research, primarily distributed and parallel computing. The idea of Tevanian was to create a new operating system, which later would have been known as NeXTSTEP.</p>
<p>NeXT first workstation was called NeXT Computer, also called "the cube". <br> Originally presented in 1987, during the "NeXT Introduction", the first machines were tested just in 1989, many months after their presentation.</p>

<h2> Operating System </h2>

    <h3>NeXTSTEP</h3>
    <p class='subP'>NeXT STEP is the result of the work Steve Jobs (after being kicked out from Apple) and his colleagues at NeXT. In 1988, NeXTSTEP preview was released, and in 1988 was ready to be sold. NeXTSTEP GUI was quite impressive. To implement their GUI they used Objective-C, which was an extension of the <a href='../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html'>C programming language</a>. NeXTSTEP introduced the dock and the shelf, the widgets, color icons, drag and drop for files, scrolling, etc.<br>
        
                NeXTSTEP was also used to develop the <a href='../../internet/world_wide_web.html'>"WWW" (World Wide Web)</a> at CERN during 1990 .</p>

<h2>Programming Language</h2>
                
<h3>Objective-C</h3>
            <p class='subP'>Objective-C is a <a href='../software_engineering/languages/programming_language.html'>programming language</a> that was created around 1981 by Brad Cox and Tom Love, with the purpose to add the functionalities of Smalltalk-80 to the C programming language, which was limited to structures and global functions. Objective-C supported classes, objects and protocols.<br> In 1988, NeXT got the license to use Objective-C, which would have been used to create user interfaces, the AppKit, the Foundation Kit, and the interface builder. Due to the success of these products, NeXT decided to focus just on the production of software.</p>
