                            <p>Microsoft was founded on April 4 of 1975, <a href='#microsoftlogo'><img class="right noShadow"                                      src="images/microsoft.png"  style="width:28%;" alt="Microsoft First Logo"> </a>   by <a                                                href='bill_gates.html'>Bill Gates</a> and Paul Allen                               with the purpose to                                sell BASIC interpreters for the <a href='../../hardware/MITS_Altair_8800.html'>MITS                                                    Altair 8800</a>.                                            
                            Basic is a high-level programming languages, created by them under the company Micro-Soft. <br>
                            Bill and Paul first company's name was Traf-O-Data, it was founded in 1972 with the purpose  to analyse                               traffic data. The company did not have success, but it led to the creation Micro-Soft, which was Microsoft                             original name. Paul choose this name because it was a combination of two important words, microprocessor                               and software.<br>
                            In 1980 Microsoft introduced its own operating system, based on <a href='../os/unix.html'>Unix</a>, which                               at Microsoft was named <a href='../os/xenix.html'>Xenix</a>.<br>Later Microsoft released the 
                            <a href='../os/dos.html'>MS-DOS</a>, an OS for personal computers. Its target was machine with intel 8086                             processors. It was the most commonly OS used p by <a href='../../hardware/ibmpcjr_pcat_hw.html'>IBM                                    PC</a> untill when it was substituted by others OS with a <a href='../os/gui.html'>GUI</a>.<br>
                            While working on a new OS called OS/2 with IBM, Microsoft made a big step introducing a                                               graphical extension for the <a href='../os/dos.html'>MS-DOS</a>. The new operating system was called 
                            <a href='../os/Windows.html'>"Windows"</a>. In reality the new operating system, developed in parallel                             with OS/2, was a flop for a series of reason, but still was the basis of the known Microsoft Windows.<br>
                            During 1990 Microsoft introduced its new software, Microsoft office which was an office suite for desktops                             that with the time, became one of the most famous software in the world.</p>
