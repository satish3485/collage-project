				<p><b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b><a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>, born on December 30, 1950, is a Danish computer scientist best known for the creation and development of the <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C++</a> (Cee plus plus)<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> programming language . Stroustrup received his master's degree from <i>Aarhus university</i> in Denmark, and then went on to receive a PhD in computer science at the <i>University of Cambridge, England </i><a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>, in 1979.

				<!-- CHANGE THE NUMBER IN THE <sup></sup> TAGS EACH TIME -->
				<h2>C++ Development</h2>
				<p>He started developing C++ in 1978, then called <i>C with classes</i>. Bjarne's goal was to add object oriented programming into the <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C</a> language. His version of the language included classes, default function arguments, inlining, basic inheritance and strong type-checking, in addition to all the features provided by C.
				</p>

				<p>In 1983, <i>C with classes</i> was renamed C++. Many features had been added to the language by this time, notably fucntion overloading, virtual functions, references with the &ldquo;&&rdquo; symbol and single line comments using the two forward slashes (taken from the language <i>BCPL</i><a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>). 
				<br><br>
				In 1985, Bjarne's reference to the language, entitled <i>The C++ Programming Language</i><a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a> was published: it was a very important reference as the language had not been officially standardized yet. In the same year, C++ was implemented as a commercial product. 
				<br>
				In 1990, <b>The Annotated C++ Reference Manual</b><a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>, written by Margaret Awas, was released. <!--Ellis and Bjarne Stroustrup. Why is this here?-->
				</p>
				<p>Stroustrup has also won several awards, and he is highly respected in his field. He holds the College of Engineering chair in computer science at the Texas AM University<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a> and is a visiting professor at the Columbia University.<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
