<!-- Storia -->
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Bell Labs was founded by <b>Western Electric Research Laboratories</b> and <b>AT&amp;T</b>'s department of engineering in 1925. They joined with the purpose to form  Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc. 
</p>
<p>Initially, Bell Labs developed equipment and structures for Western Electric. These were later produced by other companies in Bell's property. 
Since its foundation, Bell Labs made various discoveries in different fields. The most interesting in informatics are the <a href='../os/unix.html'>UNIX</a> operating system, and programming languages like <a href='../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html'>C</a> and <a href='../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html'>C++</a>. 
</p>
<p>During the 70s and 80s, Bell concentrated its work in computer science. Their work revolutionized informatics. In 1970, <a href='./ritchie.html'>Dennis Ritchie</a> created the programming language called C, which was then used to rewrite UNIX (before it was written in assembly), another innovative operating system which revolutionized the computer world.</p>
<p>In the middle of the 80s, Bell Labs started a new project called <b>Plan 9</b>. It was a new operating system created from UNIX with the aim of replacing it. Plan 9 was not released until the beginning of the 90s.
</p>
<p>In 1984, due to a divestiture agreement with the U.S. Government, AT&amp;T Corp. divested itself and the Bell System ceased to exist, at least as it was known. During the golden age of Bell labs, over 25,000 people were employed, including 3,300 PhDs.
</p>
<p>The projects developed inside Bell Labs led to 7 <b>Nobel prizes</b>, which reflects the quality of the work done in these laboratories.</p>
