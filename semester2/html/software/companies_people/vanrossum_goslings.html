				<h1> Research of new languages</h1>
				<p>
				In the late 80s, the need for new languages ​​to develop software
				in a more accessible way to programmers and to open new horizons rose considerably.

				<b>Guido van Rossum</b>, is a Dutch computer programmer, best known as the author of the <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">Python</a> programming language.
				</p>
				<p> 
				In the late 80s, he began a programming project as a hobby to keep him occupied at home
				during the Christmas Holidays. He decided to write an interpreter to a new language, and named the project Python
				because it was a bit irreverent and he was a fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Without knowing it, he designed the revolutionary Python language.
				</p>
				<p>
				Python is a high-level language focused on the readability of code, with the ability to express concepts
				in less lines of code in comparison to other languages, like Java, or <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C++</a>.
				</p>

				<h2>Java</h2>

				<p>
				<b>James Arthur Gosling</b> is a Canadian computer scientist best known as the father of the <b>Java</b> programming language.
				</p>
				<p>
				He was working at Sun Microsystems in the early 90s, when a research group had been created inside this company to design a
				new language based on the older languages <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C</a> and C++.
				<br><br>
				The new language eventually became more complex than the preceding ones, but they also decided to ensure that programs created with this language were compatible with any system. Consequently, they developed a virtual machine to create a virtual environment capable of running programs written in Java on any system. The language was initially called <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">Oak</a> but was eventually renamed Java.
