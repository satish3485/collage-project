				<h2>Professional Life</h2>
				<p>He later worked at MIT for several years, where he wrote the programming language <i>STOIC (Stack-oriented-Interactive Compiler)</i>. He also worked at Data General and also at Concentric Data Systems where he was also a co-founder alongwith John J. Henderson. Concentric Data Systems, Inc. was founded in 1979, and developed a spreadsheet product <i>CompuCalc</i> in 1981. 

In 1982, he co-founded the Locus development Corporation with Mitch Kapor, another american programmer. It was at Locus development Corporation that Sachs created the first version of Lotus 1-2-3, which was nearly bug-free and was praised for its speed and efficiency. The original program was implemented in the assembly language of the <i><a href="../../hardware/intel_processors80s.html">PC (Intel 8088)</a> </i> and introduced the letter hierarchical menus that are still being used in Windows applications.</p> 

<p>Sachs left Lotus development Corporation in 1985, and he currently works at <i>Digital Light & Colour<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></i>, the company he founded, which has been distributing its product, <b>Picture window</b>, since 1994. </p>
