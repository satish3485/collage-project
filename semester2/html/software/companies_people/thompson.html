				<h1>Ken Thompson </h1>
				</div>
				<p>
				<b>Kenneth Lane Thompson</b> is a computer scientist, commonly referred to as <i> ken </i> in hacker circles, best known for having created the <a href ="../os/unix.html"> UNIX </a>operating system. Some of his notable contributions include the invention of the B programming language, the definition of the UTF-8 encoding, his work on regular expressions, early text editors such as <i> QED </i> and <i> ed </i>, and the chess machine Belle.
		
				</p>
				
				
				<h2> Life </h2>
				<p>
				Kenneth was born on February 4, 1943, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He earned a Bachelor of Science in 1965 and a master's degree in 1966, both in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. 
				</p>
				<p>
				After graduation, he was hired by <a href ="bell.html">Bell Labs</a>, where he worked on the MULTICS project, a time-sharing system funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency together with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and General Electric Co. The project eventually became unwieldy and the AT&amp;T Corporation withdrew from it along with Bell Labs. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Along with colleague <a href = "ritchie.html">Dennis Ritchie</a>, he created the <a href="../os/unix.html">UNIX</a> operating system at Bell Labs in 1969. It was a scaled-down version of MULTICS. Thompson created <b>B</b> in need of a system programming language for the UNIX operating system. It was a precursor to Ritchie's <a href="../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">C</a> language.			
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In the 1970s, Thompson and Ritchie continued working together on the UNIX operating system and he, in collaboration with Joe Condon, developed a chess computer, <b>Belle</b>, which was the first computer created for the sole purpose of playing chess. It won the 1980 World Computer Chess Championship and went on to become the first master-level machine in 1983. 
				</p>
				
                <p>
                During the mid-1980s, he began working on a new operating system based on UNIX, the <b>Plan 9</b> from Bell Labs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Thompson quit Bell Labs in 2000 and was hired by Entrisphere, Inc. until 2006, when he moved to <b>Google</b> as a Distinguished Engineer.
                </p>
                
                <h2> Work </h2>
                <p>
                The <b>UNIX</b> operating system was one of the first operating systems written in a high-level language, which could be installed in almost every computer.
                
				Thompson made his first public presentation about UNIX in 1973. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Thompson thinks that the success of UNIX is due to serendipity and the fact that it helped changing from highly centralised mainframe computers to smaller, less expensive and decentralised ones, and he added:
                <br>
                
                <blockquote><i><q>
                I am a very bottom-up thinker. If you give me the right kind of Tinker Toys, I can imagine the building. I can sit there and see primitives and recognize their power to build structures a half mile high, if only I had just one more to make it functionally complete. I can see those kinds of things.
                </q></i></blockquote>
                
				<p>
                The UTF-8 encoding, developed in collaboration with <b>Rob Pike</b>, is the most widely used character encoding for the World Wide Web.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some of his recent work includes the co-design of the <b>Go</b> programming language. 
                </p>
                <h2> Awards </h2>
                <p>
                In 1983, Thompson and Ritchie received the <b>ACM Turing award</b>. This is widely considered to be the most prestigious award in the academic computer science community.
                </p>
                <p>
                In 1997, both Ritchie and Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum,
				<i>
				for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language.
                </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                In 1999, Thompson received the first Tsutomu Kanai Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
                <i> 
                for his role in creating the UNIX operating system, which for decades has been a key platform for distributed systems work. 
                </i>
                <br>
                In the same year he, with Ritchie, was awarded by President Bill Clinton the <b>National Medal of Technology</b> of 1998, for co-creating the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, as stated in the citation for the medal: 
                <blockquote><i><q> 
                led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age.
                </q></i></blockquote>
                
                <p>
                In 2011, Thompson, along with Ritchie, received the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for the Unix operating system.
