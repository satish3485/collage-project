				<p>William Henry "Bill" Gates III, born on October 28, 1955, founder of
				<a href="microsoft.html">Microsoft</a><a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>, is arguably one of the most famous
				people of the period. He began working with computers at an early age,
				and, while attending Lakeside School with the friend Paul Allen he was 
				already employed by the Computer Center Corporation. He later enrolled
				into Harvard College, in 1973.</p>
				<h2>The BASIC interpreter</h2>
				<p>In 1975, during Gates' time at Harvard, he and Allen read of a new
				computer, the 
				<a href="../../hardware/MITS_Altair_8800.html">MITS Altair 8800</a>,
				and decided to contact the computer's manufacturers, in order to sell them
				an interpreter for the BASIC programming language (interpreter that, at 
				the time, they had not yet written). MITS agreed to buy the interpreter, 
				and the two managed to write the interpreter in time for the demo (in
				just a few weeks, a considerable feat).<br>
				The interpreter became quite popular and its success allowed Gates and
				Allen to found a company, called <q>Micro-Soft</q> (the hyphen would be
				dropped a year later), though the widespread sharing of a prerelease copy
				prompted Gates to publish an Open Letter to Hobbyists, in the MITS
				newsletter, expressing dismay at widespread copyright infringement of
				software, claiming that it would discourage developers from producing
				high quality software.</p>
				<h2>The IBM deal and the rise of Microsoft</h2>
				<p>In 1981 Microsoft licensed an operating system to 
				<a href="../../hardware/ibm_1970s_hw.html">IBM</a>,
				for their upcoming personal computer, in truth they once again did not
				have the software they were selling, but they did manage to buy an operating 
				system, <a href="../os/dos.html">86-DOS</a>, from Seattle Computer Products and deliver it to IBM in 
				time.</p>
				<p>Licensing the operating system to IBM rather than selling it proved
				instrumental to Gates' fortune and the dominance of Microsoft, as, shortly
				after the release of IBM's PC, clones of the PC flooded the market and
				Microsoft was free to license the OS, now MS-DOS,
				to them too.<br>
				In the following years the partnership with IBM continued, but, in
				parallel, Gates and Microsoft kept developing their own competing
				software (which would run on competing, cheaper computers), bringing to 
				the release of the <a href="../os/windows.html">Windows</a> operating system and popular software like 
				<a href="../os/programs.html">Microsoft Office</a>.
				The partnership would finally end when Microsoft
				abandoned OS/2, an operating system they were developing for IBM.</p>
				<p>By the early nineties Gates' aggressive business practices had made
				Microsoft one of the most succesful software companies and him one
				of the richest people in the world.</p>
				<h2>Personality</h2>
				<p>Gates is reported to be a particularly competitive man, dedicated to
				winning. This was reflected by his management style and tendency to try
				and aggressively <q>conquer</q> the market, and defend it. He actively
				participated in the development of the company's software for years.
				Where <a href="../../hardware/Steve_Jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a>
				would worry about artistic perfection, Gates would simply
				try and acquire a dominant position in the industry and defend it, which
				he arguably managed to do.</p>
