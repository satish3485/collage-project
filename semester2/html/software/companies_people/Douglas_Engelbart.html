				<p><b>Douglas Carl Engelbart</b><a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>, born in Portland, Oregon, on January 30, 1925, was an american engineer and inventor, best known for inventing the <b>computer mouse</b>. He received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from <i>Oregon State College</i> and received a PhD from <i>UC Berkley (University of California, Berkley)</i>.</p>

				<h2> Professional Accomplishments </h2>
				<p>He is best known for tackling the challenges of human-computer interaction. He founded the Augmentation Research center (<b>ARC</b>) Lab in <b>SRI</b> (Stanford research Institute) International. He also discovered a law based on the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, known as <b>Engelbart's Law</b>. His inventions were demonstrated at <b>The Mother of All Demos<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></b> in 1968. 
</p>
				<p> He was greatly influenced by <b>Vannevar Bush</b>. It was only after reading Bush's article <i>As we may think</i> that Engelbart decided to explore the field of electrical engineering. By 1962, he had joined SRI International and proposed a report about his vision and proposed a research agenda entitled <i>"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"</i></p>
				
				<p>Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab and termed them as the "bootstrapping strategy" - they were designed to boost the rate of innovation of his lab. ARC became the major force behind the design and development of the oN-Line System (NLS), where he and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the computer mouse, <b>hypertext</b>, collaborative tools and precursors to the <a href="../os/gui.html">GUI</a>. He applied for a patent for the wooden shell with two metal wheels (computer mouse), in 1967 and received it in 1970. He had developed it a few years earlier with his lead engineer, <b>Bill English</b>. Engelbart nicknamed it the "<b>mouse</b>" because the tail came out at the end. He never recieved any royalties for his invention.</p>
				<p>In 1988, after Tymshare, Inc. gained control of ARC, Engelbart teamed up with his daughter Christina and founded the <b>Bootstrap Institute</b> to coalesce his ideas into a series of three day management seminars offered at Stanford between 1989 and 2000. Later, its name was changed to Doug Engelbart Institute. </p>
				<p>Engelbart received several awards during his lifetime; the most noteworthy of which were the Turing award(1997), Lovelace medal(2005), National medal of technology(2000), and Lamelson-MIT Prize. He died on July 2, 2013 at the age of 88.</p>
