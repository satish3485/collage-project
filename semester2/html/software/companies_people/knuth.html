				<h1>Donald Knuth</h1>
				</div>
				<p>
				Donald E. Knuth is a computer scientist and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University.
				Best known to be the author of <q> The Art of Computer Programming </q> , <i> the father of the analysis of algorithms </i> and creator of <a href="../os/programs.html">TeX</a>. 
				</p>
				<h2> Life </h2>
				<p>
				Donald E. Knuth was born on January 10, 1938 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
				He studied mathematics as an undergraduate at Case Institute of Technology. He was awarded with a Master's degree together with the B.S. he received in 1960. 
				</p>
				<p>
				After graduate studies at California Institute of Technology, he received a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1963. He was consultant at Burroughs Corporation and editor of Programming Languages for Association for Computing Machinery ACM publications from 1964 to 1967.
				
		        </p>
		        <p>
				In 1968 Knuth joined Stanford University as Professor of Computer Science. He introduced a variety of new courses into the curriculum, notably, Data Structures and Concrete Mathematics.
				</p>
				<h2> Work </h2>
				<p>
				Already from 1962, Knuth began to prepare a textbook about programming techniques, but this work has evolved in a seven-volume series entitled 
				<i> The Art of Computer Programming. </i>
				<br>
				The first three volumes appeared in 1968, 1969 and 1973 respectively. In 2011 he published the volume 4A. <br>
				About <i> The Art of Computer Programming </i> Knuth wrote:
				<blockquote><i><q>
				My main life's work has been to write <q> The Art of Computer Programming </q>, a work-still-in-progress that attempts to organize and summarize what is known about the vast subject of computer methods and to give it firm mathematical and historical foundations.
		        </q></i></blockquote>
		        
				
				<p>
				He took ten years from this project to work on digital typography, developing the TeX, a typesetting system,  and the METAFONT system for alphabet design.
				
	
				</p>
				<p>
                He is now retired to work full time on <i> The Art of Computer Programming </i>.
                </p>
			    <h2> Awards </h2>
				<p>
				In 1971, Knuth received the first ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Grace Murray Hopper Award. 
			
				
				</p>
				

                 <p>
                 In 1974, he was awarded the 1974 A.M. Turing Award.
                 <br>
				Bernard Galler, former president of ACM commented: 
				<blockquote><i><q>
				The 1974 A.M. Turing Award was presented to Professor Donald E. Knuth of Stanford University for a number of major contributions to analysis of algorithms and the design of programming languages, and in particular for his most significant contributions to the "art of computer programming" through his series of well-known books. The collections of techniques, algorithms, and relevant theory in these books have served as a focal point for developing curricula and as an organizing influence on computer science.
				</q></i></blockquote>
				<p>
				He has received various other awards including the National Medal of Science (1979), the John von Neumann Medal (1995), and the Kyoto Prize (1996).
                </p>
                 <p>
                 For his contributions to computer science, in 1990, Knuth was awarded the one-of-a-kind academic title of Professor of The Art of Computer Programming, which has since been changed to Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming.
                </p>
