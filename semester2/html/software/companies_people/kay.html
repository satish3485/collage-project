				<h1>Alan Kay</h1>

				<p>
				<b>Alan Curtis Kay</b> is a computer scientist, best known for his work on <a href = "../software_engineering/languages/languages_paradigms.html">object-oriented programming</a>, windowing graphical user interface design, and the Dynabook.
				</p>

				<h2> Life </h2>
				<p>
				Kay was born on May 17, 1940, in Springfield, Massachusetts. 
				He earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Molecular Biology, while working as a professional jazz guitarist. 
				He later graduated from University of Utah College of Engineering, earning a Master's degree and a PhD degree.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In 1970 Kay was hired by <a href="../../hardware/Xerox_alto.html">Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center, PARC </a> to run the Learning Research Group.
				During the 1970s, Alan Kay and other researchers created <a href = "../software_engineering/languages/most_important_pl.html">Smalltalk</a> to support the &ldquo;humanâ€“computer symbiosis&rdquo;, believing in the constructivist theory. 
				He is one of the fathers of object-oriented programming, the idea of the laptop and tablet along with the concept of the Dynabook, which was conceived as an educational platform.
				<br>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				He left Xerox PARC in 1980 and moved to Los Angeles, where he worked for <a href = "../../games/atari.html">Atari</a> before joining Apple.
				He stayed there until the closing of the Advanced Technology Group, later joining Walt Disney Imagineering until Disney ended its Disney Fellow program. 
				<br>
				After these experiences, he founded Viewpoints Research Institute, a non-profit organization built for learning and advanced software development.
				</p>
				<p>
				He later became a Senior Fellow at Hewlett-Packard until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team.
				<br>
				He also had teaching experiences at TED and he taught a Fall class at NYU in 2011.<br>
				Currently, he is the head of Viewpoints Institute.
				</p>
				
				<h2> Work </h2>
				Alan Kay about SmallTalk:
				<blockquote><i><q>
				Smalltalk&#39;s design and existence is due to the insight that everything we can describe can be represented by the recursive composition of a single kind of behavioral building block that hides its combination of state and process inside itself and can be dealt with only through the exchange of messages.
				</q></i></blockquote>
				<p>
				He also developed <b>Squeak</b>, an open source dialect of SmallTalk, with which he developed Etoys - a child-friendly computer environment and object-oriented prototype-based programming language for educational purposes.
				<br>
				More recently he began, along with other researchers, the Croquet Project, which is a software development kit used in developing collaborative virtual world applications.
				</p>
				<p>
				During his work at Xeroc PARC he instituted the following goals:
				<ol>
				
				<li>Provide examples of how small computers could be used in different areas; </li>
                 <li>Analyse how small computers could help to improve the user's visual and auditory skills; </li>
                 <li>Let children spend time learning about computers and experiment with personal ways to understand computer processes; </li>
                 <li>Report on children's unexpected uses of the computer and its software. </li>
				</ol>
				
				He was a pioneer in the development of tools that transformed computers into a <q> metamedium </q>, including all other kinds of media. He usually said:
				<blockquote><i><q> The best way to predict the future is to invent it. 
				</q></i></blockquote>
				
				
				<h2>Awards</h2>
				<p>
				In 2003 he was awarded with an Alan. M. Turing Award from the Association of Computing Machinery <i>"for pioneering many of the ideas at the root of contemporary object-oriented programming languages, leading the team that developed Smalltalk, and for fundamental contributions to personal computing"</i> and 
                the Kyoto Prize from the Inamori Foundation <i>"for creation of the concept of modern personal computing and contribution to its realization".</i>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 Along with the others, he was given a UdK 01-Award in Berlin, Germany, in 2001, <i>for pioneering the <a href="../os/gui.html">GUI</a></i>, along with the J-D Warnier Prix D'Informatique and NEC C&amp;C Prize.
                 In 2004, he received a Kyoto Price.
