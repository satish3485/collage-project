				<h1>Commodore VIC-20</h1>
                <a href="#4"><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 25em"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/commodore_vic_20.jpg" alt='Commodore VIC-20'><div class="caption">Commodore VIC-20</div></div></a>
                <p>The Commodore VIC-20 was an 8-bit computer, sold by Commodore Business Machines. It was the successor to their first ever 8-bit computer, the <a href="Commodore_PET.html">Commodore PET</a>, as well as the first ever computer to sell one million units.Due to this improved model, the sales figures of the VIC-20 plummeted, until its discontinuation in 1985.</p>
                
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Jack Tremel, seeing the success of the <a href="Apple_II.html">Apple II</a>, wanted a product that could compete in the same segment, as well as it to be presented at the 1980 CES. This triggered the project named TOI (The Other Intellect), which had as lead designers Chuck Peddle and Bill Seiler.</p>
                
                <p>Meanwhile, an engineer at MOS Technology (Robert Yannes) had designed a computer prototype he called the MicroPET. With the TOI put aside, Jack Tramiel decided he wanted the MicroPET to be mass-produced and completely finished. After all the modifications were made, the original MicroPET was almost unrecognizable, and it looked more like a Commodore PET. It was released announced in 1980, and continued its dominance until the commercialization of the <a href="commodore_64.html">Commodore 64</a>, in 1982. It was discontinued in 1985.</p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
                
                <h3>Price</h3> One of the selling points was its low price, which was set at 299$. It was one of the first low price PCs, and this pushed families to buy one as their first foray into PCs.
                    <h3>Software</h3> The VIC-20 came bundled with many tools as well as games, therefore finding an audience in almost every area.
                    <h3>Manual and heavy Ad campaign</h3> The VIC-20 came with a Full color manual, and the mentality behind this system was "For the masses, not the classes". Therefore the Ads were targeted more to the everyday user, and not the hobbyist or professional.
                    <h3>Expandability</h3>The VIC-20 had the possibility to add modules to its configuration. This allowed the most hardcore enthusiasts to buy and load programs, as well as games. You can think of it as the ancestor of the external hard drive.
                
                <h3>Ram</h3>
                The VIC-20 was equipped with only 5kB of RAM, and used the same MOS 6502 CPU as the PET. 
                <h3>Graphics</h3>
                MOS Technology VIC was used for graphics, which was a general purpose color chip designed for inexpensive terminals and game consoles.
                <h2>Applications</h2>
                <a href="#6"><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width: 13em"><img class="captionedImg" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Boy_with_Commodore_Vic_20_%281984%29.jpg" alt='The intended audience'><div class="caption">The intended audience</div></div></a>
                            
                <p>Due to factors like its low price, small memory and low-resolution display, the Commodore was primarily used in education, homes and Fort Pierce, Florida Utilities Authority thanks to the software that was available. This later point was one of the pushing forces behind the success of the VIC-20, since programmers-to-be started to learn and understand programs written in <a href="../software/companies_people/bill_gates.html">BASIC</a> (see &quot;The BASIC Interpreter&quot;) or Assembly, and copied from magazines.
                The VIC-20 was widely used was at Fort Pierce, Florida Utilities Authority. The application in this case was in order to monitor the output of two of their generators, and display the gathered data on the screens throughout the plant.
