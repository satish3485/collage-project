				<h1>AMD Processors</h1>

				<h2>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc</h2>
				<p>
					AMD was founded in 1969 Jerry Sanders and seven other persons coming from the Fairchild Semiconductor International that was an American company developing transistor and integrated circuits. Sanders was an electrical engineer and the director of the marketing sector at the Fairchild but he wanted more flexibility and opportunity and he was of the idea that his company wasn't the right place to find those things. So he decides to start his own company. Exactly one year earlier, Robert Noyce, left the same industry and founded the company called Intel, the two new born processors industries became the first competitor in the history.
				</p>

				<p>
					In November 1969 the company produced its first processor, the Am9300 that had a 4-bit register, which appear on the market in 1970. Also in 1970, AMD begins selling its first proprietary product, the Am2501 logic counter, which was very successful. But the real best-selling product in those years was the Am2505, as it was the fastest multiplier available.
                </p>

				<h2>The Am2505</h2>
				<p>
					The Am2505<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> was considered a high-speed digital multiplier that can operate with numbers represented in the two’s complement.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The distinctive characteristic were:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li> High speed multiplication without corrections.</li>
					<li> Can be used in an iterative scheme or tome sequenced mode</li>
					<li>Multiplies two 12-bit signed numbers in typically 175ns</li>
					<li>Multiplies in active HIGH (positive logic) or active LOW (negative logic) representations.</li>
					<li>Easier correction for unsigned, sign-magnitude or 1’s complement multiplication.</li>
					<li>100% reliability assurance testing in compliance with MIL STD 883<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The next important year is the 1971 when AMD begins selling the first RAM memory with the Am9102 but the real hit for that time was the AMD 8080. A microprocessor that was reverse-engineered versions of Intel 8080A. Exactly in this period the AMD rose the production of the company by the 60% and by 1975 was already sold 212 products and they were proprietary of 49 of them! In the same year they start selling also another microprocessor the Am9080A (also based on the Intel 8080) and the Am2900 bit-slice. The Am9080A had slightly better electrical parameters, smaller die size and lower power dissipation. One year later, in 1976, the company signed a cross-license agreement with Intel, which gave AMD status of authorized second-source company. AMD manufactured a full line of 8080 microprocessors in plastic and ceramic packages, in 4 speed grades (from 2 MHz to 4 MHz) and operating in commercial, industrial and military temperature ranges.
				</p>


				<p>
					AMD tried to generate new processors on the RISC base in 1987 with the Am29000 (29k) chip and also begin developing some graphic and audio processors as well as some chip for modems, like the AMD7910 or the AMD7911, and flash memory hardware.
