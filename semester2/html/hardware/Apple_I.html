				<h1>Apple I</h1>
				<h2>Basic Info</h2>
				<p>The Apple I is the first computer produced by Apple Inc. It was projected and realised by <a href="stephen_Wozniak.html">Stephen Wozniak</a> and 
				the idea of selling this product came from <a href="Steve_Jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a>.
				The Apple I entered in the computer market in 1976 during a presentation at the Homebrew Computer Club.
				The launch price was $666.66 and the product consisted in a fully assembled motherboard. </p>

                <h2>Tech Specs </h2>			   
			    <p>
				To make the computer working was necessary to buy a power source, a keyboard and a computer display. The only thing the users had to do was typing commands
				 on the keyboard and see the outputs on the display. It was a revolution 
				because before the Apple I, the users were programming using switches on the interface and the outputs were
				showed with some blinking LEDs, like <a href="MITS_Altair_8800.html">Altair 8800</a>. It had a 
				4kB Ram expandable to 64kB and used a MOS 6502 microprocessor. Inside the ROM there was an Apple I BASIC programming language.
				The Apple I was very customisable also because it was sold without a case, so everyone was able to put it wherever he wanted. The interface of the display was not graphic but textual and monochromatic with a resolution of 40x20.

				<h2>Apple Rarity</h2>
				<p> During the years following the issue of Apple I, Apple began to offer
				discounts to the Apple I owners for the  <a href="Apple_II.html"> Apple II</a> to persuade them to return back their computers. All the computers
				that were coming back, were then destroyed. This fact has contributed to the rarity of this computer: nowadays is 
				very difficult to find an original Apple I; in an auction an Apple I was even sold for $905000. </p> <br>
