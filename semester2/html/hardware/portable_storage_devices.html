<h1>Storage devices (70s-80s)</h1>

	<p> 
		A portable storage device is a <b>secondary memory</b> which can be written and red by a computer and it can be easily removed from the computer.  
		The job of the portable memory devices is to store and share data, the differences between the devices able to do this are the limit of storage and the speed of writing and reading data. <br>
		<br>
		The fist portable storage device, with many limitations, is the Punched Card (1890), but the floppy disk is the first commercial
		device convenient for storing data and personal data.

	<h2> The floppy disk </h2>
		<p>
		A floppy is a little disk that can be magnetised in such way that can hold information even without a constant energy supply.

			<h3>  8-inch disk </h3>
			<p class = 'subP'>
			The floppy disk drive (FDD) was invented at <a href="ibm_1970s_hw.html">IBM</a> by <b>Alan Shugart </b> in 1967. The first floppy disk was a <b>8-inch disk</b> (size of 20 cm)	with the capacity of 80 KB of storage. It was called "floppy" because the first version of it was flexible. <br>
			<br>
			Alan Shugart left IBM to found his own company in 1973. He produced an economic 8-inch disk whit a storage of 800 KB in 1975,
			it offered for the first time a low-cost drive in the emerging personal computer market. 
			</p>
			
			<h3> 5.25 inch disk </h3>
			<p class = 'subP'>
			A 8-inch drive was too big for the personal computer, that's why the Shugart lab produced a <b>5.25 inch disk </b>
			in 1976 with a capacity of 110 KB. <br>
			<br>
			In the early 80s a 5.25 inch floppy disks double-sided had a capacity of 360 kB and the smaller dimensions and the cheaper prize 
			contribute for the success of this device in the market. Indeed, they were used mainly by private users.
			
  			
  			</p>
  			
  			<h3> 3.5 inch disk </h3>
  			<p class = 'subP'>
			The Japanese company Sony developed a <b>3.5 inch floppy disk </b> in 1980. This kind of floppy had a storage of 438KB.<br>
 			In addition, they were smaller and they had hard-shell cartridge and an automatic shutter that would close the recording surface, when the floppy was removed from the drive. <br>
 			<br>
			The leader company IBM try to push the 5.25 inch floppy in to the market but this device was to big and soon was replaced by the more comfortable 3.5 inch floppy disk, which had the capacity of 700 KB or even 1.44 MB.

	<h2> Cassette Tape </h2>	
		<p>
			A Cassette Tape was a magnetic audio tape that in the 70s could hold 660kB of storage per side. It was the easiest, <b>cheapest way to store data</b> until the floppy disk became more accessible and less expensive. <br>
			<br>
			The biggest difference between the Tape and the floppy is that the Cassette Tape has a sequential access (you need to slide the tape to 
			arrive to the data or the song you wish), while the floppy disk has a direct and speed access to the data. With the floppy circular structure it's possible to read all the sectors of the disk. Indeed, from the 80s, the Cassette Tapes were mainly used just as music cassette. <br>
		</p>

		<h2>Compact Disk</h2>
			<p>
			A CD (Compact Disk) is a portable device published in 1979. It has small dimensions and large storage space, 
			but it cost a lot. <br>
			CDs weren't a commercial success for 3 reason: The necessity of a expensive CD-player, the cost of the CD and the impossibility to overwrite a CD. However CDs were used in the 80s to sold software, data and music.

<!-- 				<h3>How CD works</h3>
					<p class = 'subP'>
					A CD works
					with a disc of polycarbonate with inside a thin sheet of polycarbonate where a high energy laser creates depressions. The depressions in the polycarbonate substrate are called pits; 
					the unburned areas between the pits are called lands.  A low energy laser can read the pits and lands as signals of 0 or 1. The data are 
					written in a single continuous spiral starting near the hole and working at distance of 32 mm toward the edge. <br>
					</p>
				</p> -->

			<h3>CD-R and CD-RW</h3>
					<p class = 'subP'>
					A <b>CD-R</b> (Compact Disc-Recordable) is a variation of the compact disc available in 1988. It can be written one time, but in 1990 a CD burner still cost thousands of dollars. It was an expensive way to store data until 1995, when this type of CDs become cheaper and assumed the dimension that we are familiar of today. <br>
					<br>
					Only the CD-RW (Compact Disc-Rewritable) in 1997 became comfortable as a floppy disk for storing and sharing personal data; even if in 2000 the fist USB was born, the CD had a greater red speed and it became a common way to store great amount of data as backups.
