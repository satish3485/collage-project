					<h3>The origin</h3>
					<p class = 'subP'>
					The <b>first computer ball mouse</b> was made by Telefunken in <b>1968</b>. It was advertised as an optional input device for their computer systems.
					The German company Telefunken called it "Rollkugel", which means "rolling ball". With this "rolling ball" it was possible to
					make <b>simple vector graphic operations</b>, like drawing polygons. This was achieved by moving a cursor on a monitor, directed by the "rolling ball".
					<br><br>
					<h3>How it worked</h3>
					<p class = 'subP'>
					The movement on the table was interpreted in the fallowing way: <br>
					The mouse had two freely <b>rotating rollers</b>. One for the forward/backward motion and one
					for the left/right motion.
					At 45Â° it had a third roller to push the ball to the other two.
					Finally logic circuits interpreted the relative timing and calculated the direction of the rotation of the wheel.

					<h2>The Mother Of All Demos</h2>
					<p>Two months after the technical publications of the company Telefunken, the mouse became famous as an input device.
					The reason is that it was showcased in the presentation held by <a href="../software/companies_people/Douglas_Engelbart.html"><b>Douglas Engelbart</b></a>, which is still known today as the <b>Mother Of All Demos</b>. There is a recording of this particular demo on Youtube. 
					At 4 minutes and 19 seconds <a href="../software/companies_people/Douglas_Engelbart.html">Douglas Engelbart</a> uses the mouse to manipulate the data with a cursor. Later in the video, at 31:02, the mouse is clearly visible.
