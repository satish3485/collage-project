					"The best small computer in the world". That was the heading of the brochure for the NOVA.<a href="#numb1"><sup>1</sup></a>
					Data General started producing the NOVA in 1969. It was one of the first 16-bit computer and 
					led the way toward word lengths that were multiples of the 8-bit byte. The other really important aspect is,
					that it was first to employ medium-scale integration (MSI) circuits.<a href="#numb2"><sup>2</sup></a>
					The base price was $3,995, but normally RAM was added in the form of core memory, which brought the price up
					to $7,995. By 1970, 700 units were shipped.<br>
					Even high-schooler <a href="stephen_Wozniak.html">Stephen Wozniak</a>, Apple's future co-founder, was said to be enchanted with the Nova's elegantly designed architecture

					<h2>SuperNOVA</h2>
					<p>
					Supernova had the same basic organization as the NOVA: 
					16-bit word, 4 accumulators, flexible I/O facility, interchangeable core and read-only memories and 
					the same packaging design.
					<h3>Faster</h3>
					The SuperNOVA used ROM for library software.
					A full memory cycle using core memory took 800 nanoseconds for the Supernova. Using read-only memory, the cycle time was 300 nanoseconds.
					The NOVA took 400 nanoseconds longer for a full memory cycle, 1200 nanoseconds compared to the 800 nanoseconds.<a href="#numb3"><sup>1</sup></a>

					<h2>Later versions</h2>
					<div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width: 50%">
					<a href="#numb2"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/nova_840.jpg" alt="Nova 840"></a>
					<div class="caption">Nova 840</div></div>
					<p>
					In 1970/71 the Nova 800 and Nova 1200 series replaced the NOVA and SuperNOVA. The next version was the Nova 2,
					which was shipped in 1973 and the Nova 3 in 1975.
					Originally the Nova 3 was supposed to be the last Nova machine and Data General wanted to push the machine "Data General Eclipse", but
					because of high demand a Nova 4 computer was shipped.
					In total 50'000 Nova computers were sold.<br><br>
					This machines influenced the design of the <a href="Xerox_alto.html">Xerox Alto</a> and the <a href="Apple_I.html">Apple I</a>. Furthermore, its architecture was
					 the basis for the Computer vision CGP.<a href="#numb2"><sup>2</sup></a>
