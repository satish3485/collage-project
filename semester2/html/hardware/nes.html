		The Family Computer was realised in Japan in 1983, it was a revolutionary 8-bit console games 
		made by <a href="../games/nintendo.html">Nintendo</a>. When the console was published in the USA in 1985
 		it was renamed as the Nintendo Entertainment System or <b>NES</b>, the best selling console of those years.

	<h2>Inside the NES</h2>
		<p>
			<h3> CPU and Memory </h3>
			<p class = 'subP'>
			The the NES uses a <b>8-bit microprocessor</b> with a clock speed of 1.79 MHz.
			<br>
			Also it has <b>2 KB of RAM</b> and <b>2 KB of video ram</b>, which can be increased by a game cartridge. There are 16 KB of free space in the console 
			to storage files as gaming progresses; while the entire game is stored in the cartridge which can have a storage between the 8 KB and 
			1 MB. <br>
			</p>
			<h3> Picture Processing Unit </h3>
			<p class = 'subP'>
			The <a href="evolution_gpu.html">Picture Processing Unit</a> (the first graphics processors) operates at 5.37 MHz. The colour palette is made form 64 colours (6 bytes).
			The resolution of the NES is far away from the modern standard resolution, it is just 256 by 240 pixels.

	<h2> Memory management controller </h2> 
	
		<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 300px"><a href="#1"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/MMC3_NES.jepg.jpg" alt="MMC3"></a><div class="caption">MMC3</div></div>
		
		<p>
			The NES hardware was too slow to develop 
			more complex and large games, so Nintendo and videogames developer built the Multi-memory controllers (MMC), 
			a chip which is able to <b>extend the memory of the NES</b>. <br>
			<br>
			For example the game cartridge of the first The Legend Of Zelda (1987) uses the MMC1, which increase the ram.
			While the MCC3 increases the Picture Processing Unit RAM and the RAM dedicated to the audio (it was used to develop the famous video game Super Mario Bros 2.) <br>
			<br>
			Nintendo created fantastic new games, and the gaming market was able to improve without changing the NES
			and its hardware every years.  In this way the <a href="../games/videogame_crash.html">video game crash</a> of the 1983 was exceeded. <br>

	<h2> NES gamepad </h2>

		<p>
			A gamepad is an external controller for consoles, it is usually built to be used with 2 hands. 
		    <br>
			<br>
			The gamepad of the NES was a new and more complex kind of controller, it is the first controller developed for 
			a console with the <b>crosses directional</b> (or d-pad). This technology was invented by Gumpei Yokoi (A Nintendo developer), 
			while he was developing the first portable console Nintendo named <a href="../games/nintendo.html">Game & Watch</a>. <br>
			<br>
			The NES's gamepad has 4 buttons (2 for playing, 2 for selecting) and the crosses directional. This squared pad is the first 
			gamepad which presents the same commands map of a mobile arcade, that is the d-pad (or joystick) on the left and the buttons 
			on the right, the common setting of all the modern console's gamepads.  <br>
