				<h1>The IBM PC-JR and PC-AT</h1>

				<p>Even if in the same era, those 2 Personal Computers had 2 different feedbacks from the market: while the PC-Jr
				was almost considered a fail for the IBM, the PC-AT (Personal Computer - Advanced Technology) deeply innovated the
				computer architectures.</p>

				<p>The <b>PC-Jr</b> had different I/O devices which could work with: cassettes, optic pens, RGB and Composite 
				port, wired or wireless infrared 62-keys <a href="keyboards_hw.html">keyboard</a>, <a href="mouse.html">mouse</a>, speakers, a serial port and for gamers: it was out with 2 joystick ports! <br>
				It could read floppy disks, had a 300 bps modem and was one of the first models which could use VGA, the universal standard
				before the HDMI standard.<br>
				More devices was produced by third party manufacturers, The PC-Jr could use most of them. <br>
				As usual, the bigger resolution the user wanted, the less colours he could use:<br>
				with a resolution of 640x200 the colours available were 2 or 4, with a 320x200 or 160x100 resolution 4 o 16 colours could be displayed.<br>
				Remembering that we're in the end of 1983, the commercial can helps us to understand how many softwares could be installed on the PC-JR.<br><br>

				The <b>PC-AT</b> was generally better and included the functionalities of the PC-JR: with its best resolution (640x350), it could display 16 colours of the 64 available;<br>
				Its keyboard had 84 keys (still used and sold nowadays), 22 keys more than the PC-JR's keyboard.<br>
				In the most advanced version, this model had integrated a 20MB Hard Disk: The first Hard Disk which was thought for personal computers
				was the Seagate ST-506: it's released in the 1980 and it gives to the user 5 MB of free space.<br>
				On the motherboard we can found a battery which was used quite like today: it was used for the computer to remember date and time and also
				the BIOS settings needed for the boot.<br>
				Here above, the message IBM wanted to send to the customers was that the PC-AT could offer a different mean of
				space in everyday's life.<br> <br>
