				In <b>1971</b>, IBM's <b>System/370</b> was introduced. It was able to run System/360 programs. The new system included the <b>Model 145</b>, the first general-purpose business computer to use integrated circuits in all memory and logic functions<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>. As integrated circuits can be made very compact, they had up to several billion transistors and other electronic components in an area equivalent to the size of a fingernail<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>. 		
				Furthermore, the <b>IBM 129 Card Data Recorder</b> was brought into the market. It was capable of punching and veryfying, it used an electronic 80-column card reader and punch and the card could be punched automatically. A switch on the keyboard console provided the ability to toggle between the punch and verify modes.
				Its primary advantage over other IBM keypunches was that a keystroke error could now be erased by pressing the &ldquo;Backspace&rdquo; key<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

				<p>
				 IBM also introduced the industry's first flexible magnetic disk in 1971, which came to be known as the <b>&ldquo;floppy disk&rdquo;</b>. It made data handling much easier. As a result, it became widely used as a basic storage medium for small systems<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Moving on to <b>1973</b>, IBM brought about the <b>IBM 3340</b> disk unit &ndash; known as <b>&ldquo;Winchester&rdquo;</b>, after IBM's internal project name. Winchester more than doubled the information density on disk surfaces to nearly 1.7 million bits per square inch.
				 It featured a smaller and lighter read and write head that was designed to ride on an air film only 18 millionths of an inch thick. Given these great developments, Winchester technology was adopted by the industry and used for the next two decades<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>.

				Forwarding to <b>1975</b>, IBM researchers discovered the first polymer to become superconducting and lose nearly all resistance to electric current flow<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Additionally, IBM introduced the <b>IBM 5100 Portable Computer</b><a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a>, a 25kg desktop machine the size of a small suitcase that put computer capabilities at the reach of engineers, analysts, statisticians and other problem-solvers<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>. It could be transported in an optional carrying case, hence the name &ldquo;portable&rdquo;. While it may appear large today, in 1975 it was an amazing technical achievement to package a complete computer with a large amount of ROM and RAM, CRT display and a tape drive into a machine that small.

				<h2>1976&ndash;1979</h2>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width:290px">

				</div>
				<p>
				Moving to <b>1976</b>, the first <b>IBM 3800</b> <a href="printer.html" >printer</a> was released. The 3800 was the first commercial printer to combine laser technology and electrophotography. The technology sped up the printing of bank statements, premium notices, and other high-volume documents. It has remained a workhorse for billing and accounts receivable departments<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>.  
				</p>
				<p>
				In <b>1978</b>, IBM introduced the <b>3033 multiprocessor complex</b>. It included two processors with a main memory capacity ranging from 4, 194, 304 to  8, 388, 608 characters of information each, in 2, 097, 152 character increments, giving users a choice of 8, 10, 12, 14 or 16 million characters of shared storage. This provided an increased power and capacity for advanced applications such as online business data communication networks and uninterrupted data processing operations<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a>. 
				</p>
				</div>
				<div class="clearfix">
				<div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width:268px">

				</a>
				</div>
				<p>
				Additionally, IBM announced the mid-range <b>IBM System/38</b> in 1978, a general purpose computer that incorporated new semiconductor technology. It was the only commercial computer with a built-in relational database<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a>. System/38's hardware and programming innovations permitted many functions associated with large computers to be combined into a compact system. The System/38 achieved considerable acceptance in the early 1980s but was ultimately succeeded by the even more popular <b>IBM AS/400</b> midrange computer family in 1988<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a>. Moving to <b>1979</b>, IBM introduced a hologaphic scanner technology in its supermarket checkout station. It was one of the first major commercial uses of holography as &ldquo;wraparound&rdquo; light rays read the UPC (Universal Product Code) stripes on merchandise. IBM's ssupport of the UPC concept helped lead to its widespread acceptance by retail and other industries around the world<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a>. 
				</p>
				</div>
				<p>
				As a final note, IBM introduced the first disk drive to feature thin-film inductive heads and a run-length-limited (RLL) coding scheme, the <b>IBM 3370</b><a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a>. Thin-film heads led to a new era in the design of higher-performance recording heads and the "2-7" RLL code permitted higher performance while also reducing errors. Overall, this led to higher performance recording heads at reduced cost and established IBM's leadership in &ldquo;areal density&rdquo;, a term referring to storing the most amount of data in the least amount space<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a>.
