				<h2>Who is Sophie Wilson?</h2>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				Sophie Wilson, born in Leeds, England, in 1957, is a British computer scientist. Her parents were both teachers, her father an English teacher, her mother a physics teacher. She studied computer science and the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge in 1975.</p>
				<h3>Career</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				In 1977, she developed an automated cow-feeder during her first summer vacation. She is known for designing the Acorn System 1, an early 8-bit microcomputer for hobbyists, which was produced commercially by the British company Acorn Computers beginning in 1979. In 1983 Wilson contrived the instruction set for one of the very first RISC processors, the Acorn RISC Machine, which we know as ARM. The ARM processor core is now used in thousands of different products, from mobile phones and tablets to digital televisions and video games. Ninety-five per cent of today's smartphones are built around an ARM processor. Wilson also designed Acorn Replay, a video architecture for Acorn machines, which contained OS extensions for video access as well as the codecs themselves and optimized high frame rate video.
                <br>
				Wilson is now the Director of IC Design in Broadcomâ€™s Cambridge, UK office. She was the Chief Architect of Broadcom's Firepath processor. </p>
