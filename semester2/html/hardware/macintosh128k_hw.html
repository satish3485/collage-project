				<h3>The idea of the Macintosh</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				The Macintosh. The beginning of an era for Apple. When its idea wasn't born yet, <a href="Steve_Jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a> and the manager of the project Jef Raskin were arguing if the Macintosh should have been cheap or a high-quality Personal Computer.
				Michael Scott, Apple CEO, brought in Jobs' hands the whole project: from this moment, the Macintosh started to change.
				In Steve's point of view, everything should have been nice to see and simple: From the software to the hardware, even internal components.
			</p>
				<h3>The advertisement</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>

				In the 1983, Steve Jobs started to think which could have been be the perfect advertisement for the product that would have brought Apple to the success: below you can see the chosen commercial, which is still nowadays considered one of the best commercials ever.

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>Components</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				The Macintosh had a 8MHz Processor, 128 kB RAM (when the standard was only 64 kB), and a 9" monochromatic display with a quality of the image of 72 PPI.
				A 400 kB floppy was considered as more than enough space and many users preferred to lock the write on the floppy which contained the Operating System (the Mac OS) and use a second floppy for personal data.
			</p>
				<h3>Design</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				It didn't have fans inside: Steve Jobs couldn't stand noisy fans and was a supporter of silent computers.
				in the rear of its beige case, we could find connectors for the <a href="keyboards_hw.html">keyboard</a> (without arrows keys or numeric tab to force the user to use the mouse), the mouse, the printer, the modem, an external floppy disk and a monophonic speaker.
				Apple wanted to use specific connectors to avoid people to use the Macintosh with a non-Apple monitor: This strategy is still used nowadays with the most of ports or cables used by Apple products.
