				<h1>MITS Altair 8800</h1>
				<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
				<p>The Altair 8800 is considered the very first personal computer in the history
				of computer science: it was affordable and easy to obtain. Before the Altair 8800
				the word "computer" was related to big calculators, very expensive and not purchasable
				for personal use. It was featured in 1975 by the MITS (Micro Instrumentation
				&amp; Telemetry Systems) in the magazine <em>Popular Electronics</em> and its 
				inventor, Edward Roberts, created it with the hope that "one day I will give a computer
				to every person". <br>
				 </p>
				<h2>What was it like?</h2>
				<p>
				<h3>Inner components</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				The innovation of the Altair 8800 was that, with a supplement of 100$, you could buy the computer 
				ready-assembled. You could also buy it unassembled and you had to assemble it by yourself and 
				you could add some extras like an expanded memory, a teletype terminal or an Audio Cassette interface board. 
				When the Altair made its first appearance, it was composed by a metal box and inside 
				a power source, a front panel and a motherboard, made of slots, that was connected with the CPU (an Intel 8080 microprocessor) and 
				the main memory, which was placed on separate slots.
				Inside the ROM was inserted an Altair BASIC programming language (a simplified version of the standard BASIC).
				<h3>How it worked</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				The front panel was made of a big number of switches and LEDs: the only thing that you could do
				was make programs in binary using the switches and see the result with the LEDs.</p> <br>

				<!--
				<p>The following years, Mr Roberts did some powerful implementations, creating additional cards to increase 
				the RAM, for the keyboard interface or for paper tapes for data storage. He also worked on the RS-232 
				to connect the interface to a terminal. </p>

			     <h2>Curiosity</h2>
			     <p>There are some urban legends about the choice of the name. It's said that Edward Roberts asked his daughter
			     to choose the name and she chose Altair because the night before she was watching an episode of Star Trek where 
			     there was a system called Altair. A more accredited version tells that the name was chosen during a meeting 
			     of MITS. <br>
			      <a href="../software/companies_people/bill_gates.html">Bill Gates</a> worked personally on the software inside Altair and, after the success, he decided to build Microsoft.</p>
