                    The Commodore 64 is a home computer built by the Commodore Business Machines Inc. The first models 
                    started to come out of the assembly line in the August 1982. It was an unprecedented success with estimate
                    sales between 17 and 22 million copies. 
                    
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    The Commodore 64 was born from the idea to produce new chips for high-performance audio and video, 
                    with the hope that they were chosen for future video game console arcade. 
                    When in November 1981 the ICs were ready the director of the Commodore, Jack Tramiel, changed his mind 
                    and ordered his engineers to create a new computer with 64K of memory to be shown at CES in Chicago, 
                    which would take place just six weeks later. By the end of 1981 were ready 5 prototypes of this new 
                    computer called VIC30 and in the two remaining weeks before the fair, the old <a href="commodore_vic_20.html">VIC 20</a> operating 
                    system was adapted to the new computer. At the fair the C64 was a success and in August 1982 began the mass production.
                </p>
				
                <h2>The processor</h2>
                <p>
                    The Commodore 64 uses an 8-bit microprocessor built by MOS Technology and 
                    called MOS Technology 6510. 
                    It is the successor of the MOS Technology 6502 with a 6-bit internet I/O port more.
                    The new port is used for two banks-switch the machine's read-only memory in and out of the 
                    processor's address space, and to operate the dataset tape recorder.
                    There are two variants of the 6510, the first one is the NTSC and the second one is the PAL.
                    The NTSC version has a frequency of 1,023 MHz and the PAL version has a frequency of 0,985 MHz.
                </p>
                <h2>The Graphics</h2>
                <p>
                    The graphic chipset is the VIC-II. It is a microprocessor used in the Commodore 64 and in the Commodore 128.
                    This microprocessor has 47 registers, 31 more than its predecessor. 34 of these registers are used for the control of the sprites,
                    bidimensional figures that can be moved relative to the background. 
                    The VIC-II is able to manipulate 8 sprites at the same time and supported 16 colors. In the multicolor mode the resolution is 160 x 200 px
                    and the colors usable at the same time are 4, one of the background and three available for every 4 x 8pixel area.
                </p>
                <h2>The Sound</h2>
                <p>
                    The sound chips are the MOS Technology 6581 SID of the MOS Technology 8580 SID. 
                    The SID is a mixed-signal integrated circuit, it means that it has both analog circuits and digital circuits.
                    It is able to synthesize three separate voices.
                    The introduction of the 8580 resolved a problem of the 6581 which caused a short 'pop' everytime that the 
                    volume was changed and had a better sound quality because of the better division of analogic and digital circuits.
                    The 8580 works with a lower tension than the 6581 (9V the first one, 12V the second) which permisses a lower heat dispersion.
