				<h1>Xerox Alto</h1>
				<h2>Basic Information</h2>
				<h3>What is it?</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				Xerox Alto is one of the first personal computers ever built and it was released in 1973.
				It was developed by the <a href="../internet/xerox_parc.html">Xerox PARC</a> (Palo Alto Research Center).
				It has never been commercialised
				because of his production cost: it was very high compared to the average salary of that time.
				The Xerox Alto introduced the desktop metaphor: the desktop's interface represents your desk, 
				you can put on it whatever you want.</p>
				<h2>Main Innovations</h2>
				<h3>Components</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>Alto was designed with a microcode and it also had a 4-bit ALU
				 and a main memory of 128kB.
				Alto was also provided with a removable data storage of 2.5 MB similar to the IBM 2310's. The Xerox
				Alto used a BCPL language and introduced the concept of using a graphic interface to display the results of 
				the executed operations. The programmers also introduced for the first time the software technology of 
				WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), to make this first personal computer very user friendly. </p>
				<h3>Additional parts</h3>

				Alto didnâ€™t support a terminal users interface and, other than an <a href="../internet/ethernet.html">Ethernet</a> connection, 
				its main output devices were a black and white cathode ray tube screen and a Diablo printer
			    (produced by the Xerox Corporation). Alto had a customisable and removable keyboard where each key 
			    represented a bit in a set of memory locations; because of this, the user was able to perform combinations 
			    of keys to make the computer execute operations.
			    Alto was also equipped with a three buttons mouse and a 5-key chord keyset, an input device that allowed the user to make the computer execute operations by pressing several keys together, which thanks to its small dimensions it could have been used with a single hand.</p>
