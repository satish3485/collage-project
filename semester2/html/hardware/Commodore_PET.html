				<h2>Basic Info</h2>

				<p>The Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) was a series of personal computers produced by Commodore International.
				They constructed the first all-in-one computer in 1977, the PET 2001. All the components of the
				computer were placed into a single metal case, it was provided of a CPU, a keyboard, a screen and a
				<a href="portable_storage_devices.html"> cassette tape </a> recorder. </p>
				<p> The CPU was made-up of a MOS 6502 microprocessor and the computer was provided of a 4kB RAM expandable
				to 64kB. It was equipped with a Commodore BASIC language and a 
				<a href="../software/os/kernel.html">KERNEL</a> installed on the ROM; the display was monochromatic (light blue) and textual-only with a resolution of 40x25 pixel.

				<h2> Following </h2>
				<p>In 1979 the PET 2001 was replaced by the PET-N (New), that was implemented with a new monitor (green-phosphor) and a new 
				complete keyboard. The tape support was removed and KERNEL was upgraded. After the success of the PET 2001 and 2001-N, Commodore released a new series
				of computers: the PET 4000s in 1980 with an implemented 12'' display and a new version of the programming language: BASIC 4.0. It had an high success
				in didactic use with an high diffusion inside the schools.</p>

			    <p> Commodore developed also the 8000s with an enlarged screen and a softer design but was not so popular
				because of some incompatibilities with the software. </p>  The last computer of the series was the SuperPET. It was created to help
				 for teaching programming and was implemented with a second CPU: the Motorola 6809; it included BASIC for the 6502 micro
				 processor and FORTRAN, PASCAL and some other languages for the 6809.
				 The architecture of the PET series laid the basis for the following home computers like <a href="commodore_vic_20.html">VIC 20</a> and the <a href="commodore_64.html">Commodore 64</a> </p> <br><br>
