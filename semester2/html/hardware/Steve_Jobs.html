                    According to Steve Jobs the simple and elegant design of the products of a company 
                    would give a unique touch to it. In June 1981, Jobs attended the annual conference in Aspen, 
                    the theme was Italian style. Jobs for this journey into the design was a source of great 
                    inspiration convincing him that the product design should be simple yet expressive. In 1983, 
                    Jobs attended another conference in Aspen pointing out that Apple products would be basic and simple, 
                    because simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Another key component of the design for Jobs is to 
                    make products easy and intuitive to use. Jobs said, in fact, that the fundamental principle of the Apple design 
                    is to make things intuitively obvious. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Cupertino company was the first manufacturer 
                    to introduce a mass-market PC with a plastic liner, the first to use a graphical interface 
                    and adopt a consistent design language for all industrial its products. 
                    Its designers have produced objects that have become true works of art, 
                    which have revolutionized the way we think about and use the personal computer.

                    <a href="apple_lisa.html">Lisa</a> was never a great success, so much so that many consider the computer as one of the 
                    greatest failures of Apple, but there is no doubt that it was a very important model for the 
                    emergence of future Macs, and one of the most important revolution in the design of home computers. 
                    Steve Jobs was obsessed with details, his goal was to make Lisa a masterpiece not only from the point of view
                    of software and hardware, but also aesthetics. The Lisa was extremely quiet, and with a cutting edge 
                    design for its time. The only problem was the choice by executives from Apple to sell 
                    at a price much higher, then the one that Jobs wanted.
                    The Lisa is a classic example of a product too early for its time. In fact, although it was a 
                    commercial failure, the Lisa did a lot of attention.
