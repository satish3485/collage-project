				<h2>What is a supercomputer?</h2>
				<p>
				A <b>supercomputer</b> is a a computer at the frontline of contemporary processing capacity &ndash; particularly referring to the speed of calculation which can happen at speeds of nanoseconds<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>.   
				</p>
				<p>              
				<b>Supercomputing</b> is about pushing the limits of computer speed and performance. The main goal of supercomputing is to process data in order to yield a result that was previously inaccessible<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
				Supercomputers have been used for weather forecasting, fluid dynamics &ndash; such as modeling air flow around airplanes or automobiles &ndash; and simulations of nuclear explosions. These are applications with a vast number of variables and equations that have to be solved or integrated numerically through a seriies of very complex of steps, or probabilistically by Monte Carlo sampling<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Thus, supercomputers can greatly help us solve very complex problems.

				Founded by <b>Seymour Cray</b>, known as &ldquo;The father of supercomputing &rdquo;, in 1972, <b>Cray Resarch</b> &ndash; now known as Cray Inc. &ndash; was the world leader in manufacturing supercomputers. They designed a series of computers that were the fastest in the world during the 1970s and decades thereafter.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
				Seymour Cray once said &ndash; &ldquo;One of my guiding principles is, &lsquo;don’t do anything that other people are doing&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a>.
				The company reflected Cray’s emphasis on simple design and small, focused development teams. The results validated his approach.<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a>

				The <b>Cray-1</b> was a supercomputer designed, manufactured and marketed by Cray Research. The first Cray-1 system was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976 for 8.8 million USD and it went on to become one of the best known and most successful supercomputers in history with over 80 units sold for between 5 and 8 million USD a piece between 1976 and 1982, . It was primarily tasked with nuclear weapons modeling<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a>. The Cray-1's architect was Seymour Cray and the chief engineer was Cray Research co-founder <b>Lester Davis</b><a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The Cray-1 was clocked at 80MHz, it used integrated circuits, it had a word-size of 64 bits<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a> and it had an 8 megabyte (1 million word) main memory. It had  a world-record speed of 160 megaflops<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>. This made the Cray-1 the world's fastest proccessor at that time. An interesting fact about the Cray-1 is that it had a unique "C" shape, which allowed for a short distance between integrated circuits. No wire in the system was more than 1.2m long. However, over 96km of wires were included in the Cray-1<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>. 
				To handle the intense heat generated by the computer, Cray developed an innovative refrigated system using Freon<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>. 
				The Cray-1 reigned as the world's fastest from from 1976 to 1982. It was 10 times faster than competing machines, but its speed came at a cost. As previously stated, it costed about 5 and 8 million USD a piece, and it drew a gigantic 115 kW of power<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Not only was the Cray-1 fast, but it was meticulously manufactured. Each Cray-1 was hand wired and took nearly a year to assemble. Its unique vector-processing design suited it to many critical computational problems, such as cryptography, bomb simulation, and aircraft design. <a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a>

				Seymour Cray left the CEO position in 1980 to become an independent contractor, in order to concentrate his efforts on design. Another group within Cray Resarch developed the first multiprocessor computer, the <b>Cray X-MP</b>, which was introduced in 1982<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>. The Cray X-MP could support up to 4 CPUs. It was very similar to the Cray-1 but it had clockspeed of 105MHz, more than a doubled memory bandwidth and each X-MP CPU pushed up to 200 megaflops. The basic cost of the computer was 14.6 million USD, plus 3.5 million USD for the 256-megaword Solid State Disk and 2 million USD for the disks<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a>. For 15 million USD, a total of 800 megaflops could be acquired. It could support up to 16 million 64-bit words of memory, in SRAM (Static RAM) — which is equivalent to around 128MB of today’s RAM<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a>.

				The <b>Cray-2</b> took nine years to develop. It was released in 1985; each of the 27 manufactured sold for between 12 and 17 million USD. The Cray-2 was both smaller and faster than the Cray-1. It ran 12 times faster than the Cray-1. It computed what would have taken ENIAC several months in one second<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a>. To boost its performance, the logic boards were crammed incredibly tightly, meaning air cooling and Freon heat exchanging was not the best solution to cool the computer. Instead, the the entire computer was submersed in Fluorinert. With increased performance and considering the Cray-2 supported up to 8 CPUs, Cray Research was obliged to overcome a memory barrier. Consequently, the Cray 2 was designed to use &ldquo;foreground&rdquo; processors to load data from main memory to local memory (slightly similar to a cache) via a very fast gigabit-per-second bus, and then passed the instructions off to &ldquo;background&rdquo; processors which would actually perform the computation. In today’s words, foreground processors would be similar to modern CPU load and store units. The peak performance of the Cray 2 was 1.9 gigaflops, which was about twice the performance of the Cray X-MP and it was fast enough to retain the title of the &ldquo;world’s fastest supercomputer&rdquo; until 1990<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a>.

				<p>
				The <b>Cray Y-MP</b> was introduced by Cray Research in 1988. It was the world's first supercomputer to sustain over 1 gigaflop on many applications<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>. The Cray-YMP could support up to eight 32-bit processors that were capable of 333 MFLOPS each<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a>. The system could be configured with one or two Y-MP IOSs (Input/Output Subsystems) and an optional Solid State Disk (SSD) of 256 MB to 4GB capacity. The Y-MP had a measured performance of 2.144 GFLOPS and a peak performance of 2.667 GFLOPS<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a>. The CPUs ran at a blazing 167MHz and upward to over 200MHz, and they could process both 24-bit and 32-bit instructions<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a>. The operating system of choice was a Cray-developed version of <a href="../software/os/unix.html">Unix</a>.
