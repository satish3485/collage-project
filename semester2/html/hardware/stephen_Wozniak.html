<h1>Stephen Wozniak</h1>
	
	<p>			
		Stephen Gary Wozniak, named Woz, is an electronics engineer and computer programmer.
	 	He is considered one of the father of the personal computer (PC), indeed Woz single-handedly 
	 	designed both the Apple I and Apple II computers in the late 1970s.

	<h2>Before Apple computer</h2>
	
		<p>
			Wozniak was born in San Jose, California, August 11, 1950. Since when he was young he developed a <b>passion for electronic</b>. <br>
			<br>
			In 1969 Wozniak started to build a little computer board with Bill Fernandez ( the future user interface 
			architect of the apple II)'
			Also in 69, Wozniak built his version of the Blue box, becoming one of the first hacker. A Blue box
			is an electronic device who is able to hack a public phone; the Wozniak's Blue box was the first with an automatic frequency system, 
			it means that everybody was able to use it. <br>
			<br>
			Fernandez introduced <a href="Steve_Jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a> to Woz in 1971. When Jobs was working at <a href="../games/atari.html"> Atari</a> in 1973, Wozniak helped him 
			building a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout and they became friend. <br>
			In 1976 Wozniak alone designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating system for the <b>first home computer</b> 
			which was able to display characters on a TV screen, and so running programs on the screen. The <a href="Apple_I.html"> Apple I</a> was born. 
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
	<h2> Apple Computer </h2>

		<p> 
			Jobs and Wozniak found the Apple Computer on April 1, 1976 and the Wozniak's machine had to be changed to become marketable, 
			in fact the Apple I was a <b>hobbyist machine</b>.
			Wozniak used a 8-bit microprocessor MOS 6502 settled on a single circuit board with 256 bytes of ROM (Read Only Memory) and
			4K or 8K bytes of RAM. The <a href="Apple_II.html"> Apple II</a> was born. <br>
			Apple 's second computer was sold with the prize of 666,66$; even though the prize
			it was a success because it was the first home computer which had not to be assembled by the buyer (it was sold with monitor power plug and keyboard), 
			it had the ROM to simplify the Turning on, the commands was input from a keyboard and they were displayed 
			on the screen. <br>
			<br>
			While Apple computer earned its first million of dollars, Wozniak resolved some problems of the first generations of the Apple II, 
			then he developed an economic <a href="portable_storage_devices.html">floppy disk</a> drive, a better interface introducing the colours for the screen.
			In addition to Wozniak developed a BASIC (a <a href=../software/software_engineering/languages/programming_language.html>programming language</a>) 
			interpreter, he wrote some programs in the ROM and he created the <a href="../software/os/dos.html">apple DOS</a> to improve, for example, the 5.25 inch floppy drive. 
			For all this characterises the Apple II was bought by the software developer and it was a big success. <br>
			 
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
	<h2> After Apple Computer </h2>
	
		<p>
			Stephen had an accident with his private jet in 1981 and he suffered of injury to the memory for 3 months.
			Cause of that he could not work on the <a href ="macintosh128k_hw.html">Macintosh</a> project and he came back to the Berkeley university. <br>
			<br>
			Between the 1981 and the 1985 he promoted many music festivals with 500 thousand of people each.
			Seated aside in the company Woz finally <b>left Apple</b> in 1885.
			With 8 children and millions of dollars Woz becomes to organize music events, technological fairs and he started to teach. <br>
			<br>
			Today he is a teacher and the biggest financier of his town, Los Gatos. 
			The inventor of the PC has a quiet life far away from the big companies, but he remains 
			one of the greatest geniuses in the field of electronics engineer and computer programming, 
			indeed he has been included in the <b>USA National Inventors Hall of Fame</b>.
