				<h2>Commodore Amiga 1000</h2>
				<p>
				The Commodore Amiga 1000 a.k.a. Lorraine was the first Commodore International computer of the family.The presentation day of this model of Amiga was 23 July 1985 in New York: Commodore presented it with one of the most famous pop stars of the 80s: Andy Warhol.
				It was commercialized from 1985 to 1987 and it's well-known because it was the first personal computer using a preempting <a href="../software/software_engineering/multitasking.html">multitasking</a>,
				a coloured Graphic User Interface "WIMP" (a user-friendly GUI) and a 2 buttons <a href="mouse.html">Mouse</a>. <br>
				</p>
				<h3>Coloured screen</h3>
				<p>
				The Amiga 1000 was near to be the first computer capable of coloured screen: The Atari 520SRT was the first capable of that, but the Amiga still had better quality images. <br>
				<h3>Cheapest</h3>
				Since that time, Personal Computers had the problem of the price: The Amiga 1000 was one of the cheapest: 1.295,00$ was the launch price.
				<h3>CPU</h3>
				The Amiga 1000's CPU was one of the most powerful for that time: a Motorola 68000 (available in the 16-bit version or the 32-bit version) which had the power up to 7.16 MHz: Referred to nowadays computers, it was almost 300 times powerless.<br>

				<h3>RAM</h3>
				<p>
				The RAM installed into the Amiga 1000 was 256 KiB or 512 KiB, 8.000 times powerless then nowadays. I'm not including this graph for obvious motivations.

				<h3>Graphics</h3>
				The Macintosh had a monochromatic and non-multitasking Operating System, when the Amiga 1000 could display up to 16 of the 4096 available colours at the same time if using a resolution of 640x400 or even better: if using a 320x400 resolution it could display all the 4096 available colours.<br>
				<h3>Output/Input</h3>
				The Output Video signal was the same used by TVs, so even if a user hadn't a monitor or had a TV yet, he could connect the Amiga and the TV to obtain a complete computer.<br>
				
				
				It had a 3.5" DS/DD (Double Side / Double Density) Floppy drive and It was capable of managing up to 4 <a href="storagetechnologies_hw.html">Floppy disks</a> (See "1983" paragraph).				</p>
