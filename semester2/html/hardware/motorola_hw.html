				<h1>Motorola Hardware</h1>
				<h2>What was Motorola Inc.?</h2>
				<p>
				Motorola Inc. was a multinational <b>telecommunications</b> company based in Schaumburg, Illinois, United States. The company was divided into two independent public companies, MotorolaMobility and Motorola Solutions on January 4th, 2011. Motorola Inc. designed and sold wireless network equipment such as cellular transmission base stations and signal amplifiers.

				<h3>DynaTAC</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				In <b>1973</b>, Motorola demonstrated a prototype of the <b>first hand-held portable telephone</b> in the world, which later formally became the Motorola DynaTAC. 
				
				<br>
				On September 21st, <b>1983</b>, the U.S. Federal Communications Commision approved the <b>Motorola DynaTAC</b> (Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage) phone, the world's <b>first commercial handheld cellular phone</b>. As a result, Motorola's first DynaTAC cellular system began commercial operation in 1983 as well, and the phone became available to consumers in 1984, priced at 3,995 USD.

				<h3>MicroTAC</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				On April 25th <b>1989</b>, Motorola launched the successor to the Motorola DynaTAC, called the MicroTAC, which introduced an innovative new <b>flip design</b>, where the mouthpiece folded over the keypad. The MicroTAC set the <b>standard</b> of its era and became the model for modern flip phones for at least a decade after its release.

				 Jim Bernhart, then vice president and director of distribution for Motorola's cellular subsriber group said &ndash; &ldquo;This is a new category of cellular &ndash; the <b>personal cellular</b>&rdquo; &ndash; as well as &ndash; &ldquo;we view it as the wave of the future&rdquo;.

				<h2>Motorola MC6800 Line</h2>
				<h3>Processors for computers</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				In <b>1980</b>, Motorola's next generation 32-bit microprocessor, the <b>MC6800</b>, led the wave of technologies that spurred the computing revolution in 1984, powering devices from companies such as <a href="Apple_I.html">Apple</a>, <a href="Commodore_PET.html">Commodore</a>, <a href="../games/atari.html">Atari</a>, Sun and Hewlett Packard. 
				<h3>Processors for cars</h3>
				<p class = 'subP'>
				Furthermore in 1980, Motorola and its automotive customers developed the world's first microprocessor-based engine control, the <b>EEC III</b> module. The module was designed to <b>reduce fuel consumption</b> and <b>emissions</b>.

				<p>
				Moving on to <b>1984</b>, Motorola introduced the <b>MC68020</b>, the world's first true 32-bit microprocessor. The MC68020 microprocessor contained 200, 000 transistors on a 3/8&rdquo; square chip. 
				</p>		
				<p>
				
				In <b>1987</b>, Motorola brought about the <b>MC6030</b> processor as the successor to the Motorola 68020. It featured 273, 000 transistors with on-chip instruction and data caches of 256 bytes each. It had an on-chip MMU (memory management unit) but it did not have a built in floating-point unit (FPU). However, the fast 68882 floating point unit chip could be used with the 68030 processor. The integration of the MMU made it more cost-effective than the 68020 (which had an external MMU) as well as allowing the 68030 to access memory one cycle faster than a 68020/68851 combination. Furthermore, the 68030 could switch between synchronous and asynchronous buses without the need of a reset. Although the 68030 lacked some of the 68020's instructions, it lowered power draw by approximately 25% and increased performance by 5% compared to the 68020. Additionally, if the 68030's additional synchronous bus interface was used, it could accelerate memory access up to 33% compared to an equally clocked 68020.
				</p>
				<p>
				The 68030 was used in many models of the <a href="Apple_II.html">Apple Macintosh II</a> and Commodore <a href="Amiga1000_hw.html">Amiga</a> series of personal computers as well as the <a href="next_computers.html" >NeXT Cube</a> and the Sun Microsystems Sun 3/80 desktop workstation . Later, it came to be used in Alpha Microsystems multiuser systems and some descendants of the Atari ST line such as the Atari TT and the Atari Falcon. It was also used in <a href="../software/os/unix.html">Unix</a> workstations, laser <a href="printer.html">printers</a> and the Nortel Networks DMS-100 telephone central office switch.

				<h2>Notable Products</h2>
				<p>
				In <b>1974</b>, Motorola introduced the <b>Coronary Observation Radio</b> (COR), which allowed emergency personnel to transmist a patient's electrodiagram data to a hospital. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In <b>1991</b>, Motorola introduced its <b>ASTRO</b> two-way radio system in the United States of America. It was the world's first narrowband digital public safety radio system.

				In July <b>1969</b>, astronaut <b>Neil Armstrong</b> spoke the famous words &ldquo;one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind&rdquo; to Earth from the moon using a Motorola radio transponder. The transponder aboard the Apollo 11 lunar module transmitted telemetry, tracking, voice communications and television signals between the Earth and the moon.
