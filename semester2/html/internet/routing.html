				<h1>Routing</h1>
				<p>Routing is a process of selecting best paths in a network. Also in the 
				past the term rousing had a meaning of forwarding network traffic among 
				networks. Routing is used for many kinds of network, such as telephone 
				networks, electronic data networks, and transportation networks. Router 
				is network device that forwards data packets between computer networks. 
				This creates an overlay internetwork, as a router is connected to more 
				then two data lines from different networks. The very first device which 
				had approximately the same functionality as a router does today, was the 
				Interface Message Processor (MIP).</p>
				<h2>Security</h2>
				<p>External networks must be carefully considered as a part of the 
				overall security strategy. A router can include a firewall, VPN handling 
				and other security functions. Many companies produce security-oriented 
				routers which includes Cisco Systems’ PIX and ASA5500 series, 
				Watch-guard’s Firebox and many others.</p>
				<h2>Routing algorithm</h2>
				<!-- CHANGE THE NUMBER IN THE <sup></sup> TAGS EACH TIME -->
				<p>Routing algorithm determines the path selected by a packet to reach 
				its destination. It must be selected within each intermediate router which 
				output channels are to be selected for incoming 
				packets.<a href="#"><sup></sup></a></p>
				<h2>Path selection</h2>
				<p>Routing metric to multiple routes was involved in path selection in 
				order to select the best route. In computer network, the metric is 
				computed by a routing algorithm. The routing table stores only the best 
				possible route, where topological databases may store all other 
				information.<a href="#"><sup></sup></a></p>
