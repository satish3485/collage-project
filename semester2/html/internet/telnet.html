				<h1>Telnet</h1>
				<h2>History</h2>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 400px"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/20100729_1023931_image006_685193_1285_0.png" alt="ARPANET computer"><div class="caption">Network diagram for Telnet connection</div></div>
				<p>Telnet is a network protocol used on the Internet or local area 
				networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented 
				communication facility using virtual terminal connection. Telnet was 
				developed in 1968. Before 1973, Telnet was an ad hoc protocol with no 
				official definition. It used an 8-bit channels to exchange 7-bit ASCII 
				data.</p>

				<h2>Telnet Protocol Specification</h2>
				<p>On March 5, 1973, Telnet protocol standard was defined at UCLA with
				 the public of two NIC documents: Telnet Protocol Specification and 
				 Telnet Option Specifications. Historically, Telnet provided access to 
				 a command-line interface on a remote host. Most operating systems with a 
				 TCP/IP stack support a Telnet service for remote configuration. The term 
				 telnet sometimes refer to the software which implements the client part 
				 of the protocol. Also, to telnet means to establish a connection with 
				 the Telnet protocol, either with command line client or with a 
				 programmatic interface. There were also attached specifications for 
				 Telnet options which allow negotiation of binary transmission, echoing, 
				 reconnection, suppression of “Go Ahead”, approximate message size, use 
				 of a “timing mark”, discussion of status and extension of option code 
				 set. Dave Walden prepared these specifications with the help of Bernie 
				 Cosell, Ray Tomlinson and Bob Thomas. Also these specifications have 
				 been prepared by Jerry Burchfiel and by David Crocker. These options 
				 cover most of the capabilities of the current version 
				 of Telnet.<a href="#"><sup></sup></a></p>
				 <h2>Security</h2>
				 <p>When Telnet was developed, most users of networked computers were in 
				 the computer departments of academic institutions, or a large private 
				 and government research facilities. After bandwidth explosion of the 
				 1990s, the rise in number of people with access to the Internet, and by 
				 extension the number of people attempting to hack other people’s servers, 
				 made encrypted alternatives necessary. So computer security experts, such 
				 as SANS Institute, recommended that the use of Telnet for remote logins 
				 shout be discontinued under all normal 
				 circumstances.<a href="#"><sup></sup></a></p>
