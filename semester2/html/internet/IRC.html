                <h3>History of IRC</h3>
                                <p>

IRC was invented in august 1988 by Jarkko "WiZ" Oikarinen when he wrote the first IRC client and server at the University of Oulu, in Finland. Himself wrote <i>""The birthday of IRC was in August 1988. The exact date is unknown, at the end of the month anyways.""</i> He wanted to replace MultiUser Talk, an early chat program developed by Jukka Pihl, useing a BBS software. BBS means "bulletin board system" that is a computer system running software that permits users to connect using phone line. The porpose of BBS was allow sharing, in fact bulletin board refers to board were, usually in a office, people paste paper and post-it. 
                </p>
            <p> 
                    
So "WiZ" takes this idea and extend it in IRC. First IRC's server was named tolsun.oulu.fi. Then he managed to create a new server outside the university. Whit some friend from Helsinki and Tampere Universities he started running IRC servers and numbers of users rapidly incrased. Soon other brilliant students from others istitutes joined and in November 1988 IRC had spread across the Internet. In summer of 1989 there were 40 servers worldwide. It's important underline the main idea: free speech and freedom. In fact thousand of users started chatting on IRC's servers, one example can be EFnet, "Eris-Free Network, founded in 1990  which has over fifty-thousand users and eight thousand active channels.
