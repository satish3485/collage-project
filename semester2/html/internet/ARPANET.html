				<h1>ARPANET</h1>
				<h2>History</h2>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 300px"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/03-arpanet-cain.jpg" alt="ARPANET computer"><div class="caption">ARPANET computer</div></div>
				<p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was one of the
				world’s first operation packet switching networks. ARPANET was
				established in 1969 and served as a testbed for new networking
				technologies, communicative many universities and research centres. 
				The first units that formed the ARPANET were UCLA and the Stanford 
				Research Institute, and then University of Utah. 

				Before ARPANET almost all computer systems consisted of a huge computers,
				most of them being the size of an entire room. The aim of ARPA was to built 
				a networked system that could stretch across the United States, linking 
				different organisations in a special way. The first stage of ARPANET was 
				much more modest: four computer system which were located in different 
				places and linked together using existing phone lines and four Interface 
				Message Processors (IMPs).</p>

				<h2>ARPANET Protocols</h2>				
				<p>When the ARPANET project began, there was no system that could 
				allow different computers to share information. This was a reason why the 
				ARPANET team decided to create a specific system of protocols that the 
				host computers and IMP’s would follow. Network Working Group formed to 
				take on the job. On the first try, the creation process was disjointed 
				and chaotic. These protocols were established through its RFCs by the 
				ARPANET team. Also the team recognised that there had to be two 
				specific tasks. The first was to create a way for users to log into the 
				system and the second was to make it possible to move files from one 
				computer to another. Remote login became known as Telnet, and File 
				Transfer Protocol (<a href="FTP.html">FTP</a>) included moving files back and 
				forth.</p>
				
				<h2>Network Control Program (NCP)</h2>
				<p>Also the team started to design the Network Control Program (NCP), a 
				symmetric host-host protocol. This was a procedure which allowed 
				computers to communicate within the network by adding more hosts to the 
				network and making it bigger. NCP also controlled the path and flow of 
				data over ARPANET. Packet switching was also a new way for sending data. 
				In packet switching, host computers divide each file into 
				smaller segments called packets. Once the packets are transferred, the pieces 
				are reassembled into the original files.<a href="#"><sup></sup></a></p>
				
				<h2>The End of ARPANET</h2>
				<p>Over the course of 8 year, starting from 1969, ARPANET grew from a network of four 
				different computer sites to one with one hundred and eleven computers 
				belonging to universities, research facilities and the military. Another
				ARPANET network was created and it included <a href="usenet.html">USENET</a>, <a href="ethernet.html">Ethernet</a>, CSNET 
				and BITNET. In 1983, the military section split off from ARPANET and was 
				connected to a specific network named MILNET, 
				which would later become part of the Department of Defence Data Network (DDN). 
				In 1986, five supercomputer centres formed a new network called NSFNET, 
				which included several universities. People referred to 
				this large collection of networks and gateways as the Internet. ARPANET’s 
				infrastructure became old and system’s IMPs were not as effective as the 
				computer nodes in other networks. Then in 1990, DARPA pulled the plug on 
				the ARPANET project.<a href="#"><sup></sup></a></p>
