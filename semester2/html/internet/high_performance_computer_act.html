				<h1>	High-Performance Computing Act of 1991			
</h1>
				<h2>America retakes impetus</h2>
 <em>"To provide for a coordinated Federal program to ensure continued United States leadership in high-performance computing..."</em> 
<h3>Introduction</h3> 
                <p>

The Congress of the Unite State of America in 3 January 1991 published “High-Performance Computing Act” for <i>"help ensure the continued leadership of the United States in high-performance computing”</i>. It is also knows as  the Gore Bill act since it was introduced by Senator Albert Gore, Jr.. You can find original text at this link <a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
                </p>
<h3>"Finding"</h3> 
<p>
In sec.2 the “Finding” are presented, clearly the most importants are the first two. 
    The text says: <i>“Advances in computer science and technology are vital to the Nation's prosperity”</i> 
Congress underlines the fundamental connection between technology’s discoveries and state’s 	infrastructures. In point (2) it bring to light another important matter: American was losing  it’s power in technology. In fact <i>“ The United States currently leads the world in the development and use of high-performance computing for national security, industrial productivity, science, and engineering, but that lead is being challenged by foreign competitors.”</i>  Now American lost it’s electronics empire due to china, and others countries, cheap manufactory, but it keeps well enough its informatics field, for example in Silicon Valley that is one of the most advance technology center in the world.
    </p>
  <h3>"Purpose"</h3> 
          
<p>
Next section are the purpose, the best way to understand that is read the official section, quoted below: </p>

            <ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>(1) expanding Federal support for research, development, and application of high-performance 
    computing in order to:</li>
    <li>(A) establish a high-capacity and high-speed National Research and Education Network;</li>
	<li>(B) expand the number of researchers, educators, and students with training in 
	high-performance computing and access to high-performance computing resources;</li>
	<li>(C) promote the further development of an information infrastructure of data bases, 	
	services, access mechanisms, and research facilities available for use through the Network;</li>	
	<li>(D) stimulate research on software technology;</li>
	<li>(E) promote the more rapid development and wider distribution of computing software </li>
	<li>tools and applications software;</li>
	<li>(F) accelerate the development of computing systems and subsystems;</li>
	<li>(G) provide for the application of high-performance computing to Grand Challenges;</li>
	<li>(H) invest in basic research and education, and promote the inclusion of high-performance </li>
	<li>computing into educational institutions at all levels; and</li>
	<li>(I) promote greater collaboration among government, Federal laboratories, industry, </li>
	<li>high-performance computing centers, and universities; and</li>
<li>(2) improving the interagency planning and coordination of Federal research and development 
on high-performance computing and maximizing the effectiveness of the Federal Government's 
high-performance computing efforts.</li>
        </ul>
           
<p>
In others words the main propose is base the next generation of improvements on technology to build a web that can connect every sector of the state and can enhance communication in order to guarantee a fastest share of information. Next section, sec.4, is about definition of technical word that we wont talk about.
    </p>
      <h3>"Sec.101"</h3> 
        
            <p>
                Sec.101 “ National High-Performace Computing Program” highlines that the President <i>“shall implement a National High-Performance Computing Program”</i>. So establish the priorities of compute's research in all federal’s institutes for archives a action’s coordination. 
                </p>
              <h3>"Agency Activities"</h3> 

                <p>
                Others sections, contained in title II “Agency Activities”, are specifications of relation between agency and the laws. Sec 201 is about National science foundation, sec.202 National aeronautics and space administration (NASA). It's divided in two part, a and b. First one emphizes the necessity to improve research on <i>  high-performance 
computing, particularly in the field of computational science</i> for improve booth space and earth missions. Part b is about appropriation for fiscal years reserved for NASA; hundreds millions. </p>
                <p>Next section, 203, concerns Energy Departament, a crucial sector in America's economy. Part "a" shows the obligations of  Secretary of 
Energy. In brief they are: conduct high-perfomance researh about energy applications, human resources in computational science. Thus he shall <i>"provide for networking infrastucture</i> to support energy activities. The resposibilities for each Collaborative  Consortia are quoted from text:  
                    </p>
                            
        
                           <ul style="list-style:none;">     
<li>(1) conduct research directed at scientific and technical problems whose solutions require the application of high-performance computing and communications resources;</li>
<li>(2) promote the testing and uses of new types of high-performance computing and related software and equipment;</li>
<li>(3) serve as a vehicle for participating vendors of high-performance computing systems to test new ideas and technology in a sophisticated computing environment; and</li>
<li>(4) be led by a Department of Energy national laboratory, and include participants from Federal agencies and departments, researchers, private industry, educational institutions, and others as the Secretary of Energy may deem appropriate.</li>
                               </ul>

  <p>         
It's crucial understand the new level of interaction between every sector that could be possiblev only with internet.
Moreover there are some specifications for <i> "Technology  Transfer"</i> that underline the importance of sharing results of research  that <i> "shall be transferred to the private sector"</i>. The Secretary of Energy shall transmit a report on product of this activities to the Congress. Then there are legal specification about appropriations like before, the amount of money is similar to that allocated for the NASA.  </p>
        <p>
Sec.204 concers "Department of commerce activities". Its responsibilities are <i> in primis</i> <i>"conduct basic and applied measurement research needed to support various 
high-performance computing systems and networks"</i>. Then organized interoperability of high-perfomnce computer network developing <i>"measurement techniques"</i> and a <i>"common user interfaces"</i>. Last important point is <i>"be responsible"</i> for work up on <i> "benchmark tests  and standards" </i> for hardware and software. In fact the text says:
                           <ul style="list-style:none;">

            <li>(1) the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall:</li>
<li>(1) conduct research directed at scientific and technical problems whose solutions require the 
application of high-performance computing and communications resources;</li>
<li>(2) promote the testing and uses of new types of high-performance computing and related 
software and equipment;</li>
<li>(3) serve as a vehicle for participating vendors of high-performance computing systems to test 
new ideas and technology in a sophisticated computing environment; and</li>
<li>(4) be led by a Department of Energy national laboratory, and include participants from Federal 
agencies and departments, researchers, private industry, educational institutions, and others as 
the Secretary of Energy may deem appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>  
Furthermore it's mentioned <i>"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"</i> that have to conduct scrutinized research about weather prediction and ocean science and produce a new forecast for prevent natural disastres.</p>
            <p>
Sec.205 talks about "Environmental protection agency activities" that must <i>" conduct basic and applied research"</i> with <i>" computational techniques and software tools"</i> in order to study ecosystem and atmospheric. An other implication in this sector for computer is dynamics models, that are useful for determinate climatic variations.
                </p>
                <p>
Sec.206 underlines the "Role of the Department of Education" wich shall coordinate and share <i>"activities with libraries, school facilities, and education research 
groups "</i> 
 </p>
    <p>
    Sec.207, "Miscellaneous provisions", highlights in wich case is possible or not a provision.
        </p>
    <p>
    sec.208 names is <i>"Fostering United States Competitiveness in high-performance computing and related activities"</i>  .It is very interesting, the title shows its purpose; in fact it emphasizes the role of high-performance computing and associated technologies. They are <i>"critical to the United States 
economy."</i>, and a new incentive in this sector can give a enormous economic intake. The last point in the law explains in detail how the annual report to Congress has to be.
