				<h1>Network Security<a href="#5"><img src="images/n_security.png" alt="Network security" class="right" style="width: 350px "/></a></h1>
				<p>Several key events contributed to the birth and evolution of computer and network security.If we take one of some examples from early, A Polish cryptographers created an enigma machine in 1918 that converted plain messages to encrypted text. In 1930, Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician broke the code for the Enigma. Securing communications was essential in World War II.There were many issues of Network security in 70s which for which efforts were made. Eventually in 80s it baecame esssential need, Most of the security issues in the 80s were born beacause of directly communicating with a computer or network via modem, thats the Internet, it created a vastly under protected environment of interconnectivity of networks which threatened securityand made it complicated even more. For example with the Internet, there came out a problem of limitless number of virtual access points coming through persistent connections with often unknown entities outside your network.Before this,the main cocern used to be to protect a single access point.</p>

                <h2>1970s</h2>
                <p>In the early 1970s, the Creeper<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> virus was detected on ARPANET<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> during 1970s,Infected systems displayed the message,<i>'I'M THE CREEPER : CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.' </i>,Reaper program was anonymously created to delete Creeper. Reaper was aanother virus it spread to networked machines and if it located a Creeper virus, Reaper would delete it. The Telnet protocol was developed. This opened the door for public use of data networks that were originally restricted to government contractors and academic researchers.</p>
                <h2>1980s</h2>
				<p> <a href="#6"><img src="images/cert_logo.jpg" alt="cert_logo" class="right" style="width: 100px "/></a>The hackers and crimes relating to computers were beginning to emerge. The 414 gang are raided by authorities after a nine‐day cracking spree where they break into top‐secret systems. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 was created because of Ian Murphy’s crime of stealing information from military computers. A graduate student, Robert Morris, was convicted for unleashing the Morris Worm to over 6,000 vulnerable computers connected to the Internet. Based on concerns that the Morris Worm ordeal could be replicated, the <b>Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a></b> was created to alert computer users of network security issues. In 1988 a hoax was released by Robert Morris about a virus spreading over networks and changing port and drive configurations. According to the warning, the alleged virus infected 300,000 computers in the Dakotas in under 12 minutes. November 1988: a network epidemic caused by the Morris Worm. The virus infected over 600 computer systems in the US (including the NASA research center) and almost brought some to a complete standstill. Like the Christmas Tree worm, the virus sent unlimited copies of itself and completely overloaded the networks. A popular antivirius program; Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit was released onto the market in 1988. The program was created by UK programmer, Alan Solomon, and was widely used until 1998 when the company was taken over by US-based Network Associates (NAI).</p>
                <h2>1990s</h2>
                <p>When in 1990s, Internet became more common to public, then the security concerns also increased tremendously. Approximately 950 million people use the internet today worldwide. On everyday , there are approximately 225 major incidences of a security breach. These security breaches could also result in monetary losses of a large degree.Threats witnessed during this decade included Michelangelo virus, Melissa, and Concept. Distributed denial of service attacks and the bots that made them possible were also born, such as Trin00, Tribal Flood network and Stacheldracht. Beyond malware, AOL<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> suffered through the first real phishing attacks as fraudsters aimed their efforts at stealing users' credentials. Privacy watchdogs called out in concern as tracking cookies were born, allowing ad networks to monitor user surfing behaviors in a rudimentary fashion</p>
