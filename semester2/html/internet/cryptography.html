				<h1>Cryptography</h1>
				<h2>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</h2>
				<p>The DES was once a predominant symmetric-key algorithm for encryption 
				of electronic data. DES was developed in the early 1970s at IBM and also 
				was based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel and then this algorithm 
				was submitted to National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency’s 
				invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive 
				government data. On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the 
				Federal Register.Also DES is the archetypal block cipher- and algorithm 
				that takes a fixed-length string of plaintext bits and transforms it 
				through a series of complicated operations into another cipher text bit 
				string of the same length. In 1976, according to the consultation with 
				NSA, the NBS eventually selected a modified version, which was published 
				as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the 
				United States in 1977. DES is now considered to be insecure for many 
				applications.</p>

				<h2>Cryptanalysis</h2>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 300px"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/Cryptography.png" alt="Public-key Cryptography"><div class="caption">Public-key cryptography</div></div>
				<p>For breaking full 16 rounds of DES with less complexity than a 
				brute-force search, there are known three attacks: differential 
				cryptanalysis (DC), linear cryptanalysis (LC), and Davies’ attack. DC 
				was rediscovered in 1980s by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir. And also DC was 
				known earlier to IBM and the NSA and kept secret. LC was discovered by 
				Mitsuru Matsui and this method was implemented and also was the first 
				experimental cryptanalysis of DES to be reported. Davies’ attack is 
				different from previous ones because they were general techniques and 
				can be applied to a number of schemes, but Davies’ attack was a 
				specialised technique for DES. Donald Davies was first who suggested 
				it in the eighties and it also was improved by Biham and 
				Biryukov.<a href="#"><sup></sup></a></p>
				<h2>Public-key cryptography</h2>
				<p>Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a 
				class of cryptographic algorithms which required two separate keys. First 
				one is a secret (or private) and the second one is public. The public key 
				is used to verify a digital signature; whereas the private key is used to 
				decrypt cipher text or to create a digital signature. Public-key 
				algorithms are fundamental security parts in crypto systems, protocols 
				and applications. They underpin various Internet standards, such as PGP 
				and GPG.<a href="#"><sup></sup></a></p>
