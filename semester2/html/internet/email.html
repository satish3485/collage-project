                The history of the e-mail is a controversial topic. In 2012 CompuServe claimed that their employee VA Shiva Ayyadurai invented the term “email” in 1978 to name the first email system. It was used at the UMDNJ campus 1980. The first commercial use was in April 1981.

                The standard opinion about the email history says that the email origin goes back to the 1970s and 1980s, and was developed by teams of <a href="ARPANET.html">ARPANET</a>. In 1972 Ray Tomlinson used for the first time the @ symbol to denote sending messages from one computer to another. In 1974 email became important for military users and changed Arpa’s purpose. After a couple of years 75% of all traffic in ARPANET was email. Step by step it was developed and became something that everybody all over the world wanted to use. <!--<a href="#"><sup>1</sup></a>-->

                <a href="email_protocols.html">SMTP</a> was the first important email standard. Then Pegasus mail appeared. In 1988 Steve Dorner developed Eudora, one of the first good commercial systems. The providers Hotmail and Yahoo made email available free of charge after the <a href="world_wide_web.html">World Wide Web</a> appeared. After a short amount of time the medium was being used by millions of people.

                <h2>Impact on Communication</h2>
                
				<p>
                The invention of email made a huge impact on the way people communicate.  It allowed instant access to recipients all over the world. The flow of information between individuals got much faster and it got to be very efficient. It came to be the preferred form of sending documents and files quickly, and replaced a big portion of postal mail and courier services. Another important change email gave us is the ease to stay in touch with friends, relatives and business partners. The expensive long-distance phone calls were replaced with emails.<!--<a href="#"><sup>1</sup></a>-->
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Using email is a big advantage for undeveloped areas and people in isolated regions. Internet access through smartphones and tablets has removed the place and time barriers, and thereby further enabled the widespread use of email.

                <p>
                One negative side effect of email is the <a href="network_security.html">security problem</a>. You can get an email with an attached fast acting virus, which can delete or copy all of the data on your computer. Confidential information is in danger of loss when one communicates through the medium of email. An email can easily be accessed by a third person. This is very problematic for the work sector.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                More and more people prefer communicating through electronic mail rather than interacting with others in live meetings. Even though other real-time electronic communication options have become popular (mainly for younger generations) in recent years, email is still a highly used communication form, especially for businesses.

                <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

                Email is a high-speed and convenient way to exchange messages. The messages can be typed wherever you want if a mobile phone, laptop, tablet or a desktop computer with internet connection is available. It arrives at the receiver within seconds or minutes anywhere in the world. Many types of files can be attached to the messages. Any information contained in an email stays always accessible. It’s easy to archive, search and organize all the emails you have sent or received. Except for the costs of accessing the internet, sending and receiving emails is free.

                A disadvantage of an sending or receiving an email message compared to a regular letter is that it is not private and not personal. The big problem with emails is the unsolicited emails that are sent in incredibly big amounts. These junk mails, also called spam, can clog email programs or mail servers. Therefore, filters sort out the unwanted mails automatically. However, these filters can be too greedy or too weak. Fact is, that in spite of all the anti-spam-tools and legislation there is still a huge amount of mailing lists and newsletters which continue to send their junk mails.

                Email quickly became an important marketing tool for businesses. With the click of a button thousands of potential costumers were able to be reached without any costs. That automatically increases the amount of customers and the profits. With email marketing it is possible to see how many people received the message, how many opened it and how many clicked through the links and made a purchase. This means that one can easily track the effectiveness of email campaigns. The important point here is to have the permission of the customer to send him or her commercial email. If the costumer receives to much mail, he or she could get annoyed and could develop a negative opinion about a company. When emails are reported by several costumers as spam, the host could shut down the website.
