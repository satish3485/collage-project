				<h1>Gopher</h1>

				<p>
				Gopher is a <a href="tcp_ip.html">TCP/IP</a> layer protocol designed for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents over the Internet. It was designed from the start to look and work like a read-only global network file system. It was made to work like a basic file system, so it was composed of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus. The protocol uses the TCP port 70 to connect to a Gopher server.
				</p>
				<p>
				You can't directly check out a Gopher site with today's web browser, unless you can use extensions or have an intermediate proxy server do the translation for modern browsers<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 

				<h2>Origins</h2>

				<p>
				Regarded as the predecessor and, in its early stages, an alternative to the <a href="world_wide_web.html">World Wide Web</a>, the first Gopher system was released in the spring of 1991 by a team led by Mark P. McCahill from the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.html">University of Minnesota</a>, whose mascot is a gopher (Goldy Gopher), hence its name. It's also an appropriate name because a gopher digs the ground to reach a desired location and also represents an assistant who runs errands.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>

				<p>
				Its main goals were:<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Act as a distributed document delivery system</li>
				 	<li>Familiar file-like hierarchical structure</li>
					<li>Simple syntax</li>
					<li>Cheap and quick system to create</li>
					<li>Implementation of searches</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Evolution</h2>

				<h3 class=“subP”>Growth</h3>

				<p class=“subP”>
				While the <a href="world_wide_web.html">Web</a> was still in its infancy, the higher education at the time saw the ease of setting up a Gopher server for Campus-Wide Information Systems (CWISs), adding to that links to other sites’ line directory and resources contributed to its quick adoption. In 1992, the standard for looking up an <a href="email.html">e-mail</a> address was in the Gopherspace.
				</p>

				<p class=“subP”>
				Originally, Gopher was text-only, but eventually evolved to graphical clients. It even got a new version called Gopher+, that allowed additional functions for the graphical clients. Network administrators loved it because it used few network resources and the first large-scale electronic network of libraries.
				</p>

				<p class=“subP”>
				On November 17, 1992, the search tool Veronica (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized Archives) was introduced, providing a searchable index of Gopher. It was so popular that it became overloaded by the traffic. It is the equivalent of Archie for <a href="FTP.html">FTP</a>.<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>
				</p>

				<h3 class=“subP”>Decline</h3>

				<p class=“subP”>
				However, <a href="HTML.html">HTML</a> quickly started dominating and people started migrating from gopher servers to the <a href="world_wide_web.html">Web</a>. A commonly held idea was spread around that the Gopher protocol almost disappeared because of the threat that, in 1993, the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.html">University of Minnesota</a> would request fees for using the protocol, while <a href="HTML.html">HTML</a> was completely open since its inception and its form was a lot less rigid.<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>
				</p>

				<p class=“subP”>
				Because of that, the University of Minnesota released the source code of its applications tied to the protocol under the <a href="../software/eco_society/free_software.html">public GNU licence</a>. Robert Alberti, co-author of the protocol, contested this opinion in his memoirs by demonstrating that its decline came from the introduction of the image tag (IMG) in <a href="HTML.html">HTML</a>, which up until then only displayed text, like Gopher.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>
