					<p>This Japanese corporation was mostly famous for it's <a href="arcadegames.html">arcade games</a> 
					and for starting the <a href="arcade_golden_age.html"><b>Arcade Game Golden Era</b></a> with the release of 
					<a href="shooters.html"><i>Space Invaders</i></a> in 1978. After this big hit, the Taito Corporation 
					followed up their success with other successes like <i>Bubble Bobble</i> in 1986 or <i>Double Dragon</i> 
					in 1987.Not only were they famous in Japan and America, but their games were imported worldwide and so their company 
					grew stronger.

					This company was founded by a Russian business man called <b>Michael Kogan</b> in 1953. It started as a 
					vending machine distributor under the name <b>Taito Trading Company</b>, but then they took another route 
					and began manufacturing their own arcade machines in the 1960s. After releasing their first game in 1973, they 
					changed their name to <b>Taito Corporation</b>. Three years later in 1978, they hit their peak after the release 
					of <i>Space Invaders</i> which because of its humongous popularity, started the <b>Golden age of arcade video game</b>.
					Since the game got shipped to the U.S.A, in 1979 a new division of the Taito corporation was created called the<b>
					Taito America Corporation</b>. Thanks of this corporation Taito was able to release arcade games also in North America, like 
					<i>Speed Racer</i> in 1974 or <i>Bubble Bobble</i>. Later, in 1988 was created another division in North America 
					called <b>Taito Software Inc</b>. This division focused on computer or console games, even if Taito was mostly popular for it's 
					arcade games. Until 1991, Taito kept releasing a variety of different games that go from <b>action platforms</b>, 
					to <a href="shooters.html"><b>shooters</b></a>, to even <b>beat 'em up</b>.

					This game was made before Taito reached its peak in 1978 with the release of <i>Space Invaders</i> because it was released 
					three years earlier in 1975. <i>Gun Fight</i> (or <i>Western Gun</i> in Japan and Europe) was an arcade game where the player 
					would shoot another character with the use of a revolver. This was revolutionary because this was the first game that showed actual 
					<b>human versus human</b> combat, the player that played as a cowboy would shoot another player playing as a cowboy with a revolver. 
					This is why this game was a <b>two-player</b> arcade game that felt more like a duel because as soon as a player shoots the other one, 
					he wins the duel (which means that he gains one point). There were many variations of this game, not only did the title change, but for example,
					for the version released by <b>Midway</b> the arcade machine contained a microprocessor which made it the first game to use one. Another example is the 
					version ported in 1978 in the <b>Bally Astrocade</b> console, which contained a coloured version of this game. However, it was the <a href="midway_games.html"><b>Midway's</b></a> 
					version that was very important because the insertion on the microprocessors helped make their next big hit called <i>Space War</i>.

					This game was first released by Taito in 1986 as an <b>action platform</b> arcade game where you would play as one 
					of two <b>bubble dragons</b>, either <b>Bub</b> or <b>Bob</b>, to rescue the dragons girlfriends from the 
					<b>Cave of Monsters</b>. In this platform the player needs to clear <b>100 levels</b> in order to win. In these levels the 
					player could navigate by moving side to side or jumping from one platform to another. Each level contained 
					platforms, holes that the player could fall in and ennemies he needed to defeat by <b>blowing bubbles</b> at them to trap them and 
					then <b>popping</b> these bubbles with the spikes on their back. When the bubbles popped, they dropped food that could be picked up 
					by the dragon to gain points. And when every enemy was defeated, the player could advance to the next level. Not only did difficulty  
					increases as the player goes further into the game, but also if an enemy is the remaining enemy or if he escapes from a bubble, 
					he enters a <b>rage</b> state where he turns pink and begins moving faster making him more dangerous. Also, if the time runs out an invincible enemy
					that the player needs to evade appears.After it's fame the game was ported into other systems like the 
					<b>Commodore 64</b> or other home computers that just helped spreading the game not only around the world but on every hardware at the time.

					This game was made in 1987 as an arcade <b>beat 'em up</b> developed by <b>Techn≈çs Japan</b>, but published by Taito 
					and this is important because it's Taito that brought this game to Europe and America from where it got very 
					popular mainly as an arcade game even if it was also featured in other hardwares like the <b>NES</b>.
					In this game you played as one of two twin brothers called Billy or Jimmy Lee with the intent of rescuing a 
					girl called Marian. Since this game was a beat 'em up, the player or players needed to fight against hordes of enemies to proceed,
					through the level. On the arcade version there were two sets of a <b>joystick</b> and three buttons to perform different 
					attacks. By combining these attacks the player could perform <b>special moves</b> like grabbing and throwing an enemy, he could also 
					pick up weapons dropped from said enemy.</p> <p> This game was pretty short with only four stages ranging from the city's back streets to 
					a forest, however it was pretty difficult making it addictive. And in the final scene, if the game was played by two players, after beating the 
					last boss they would fight each other over the girl. In the end this game became a very popular arcade beat 'em up because it had 
					the possibility of playing with cooperatively which made it one of the most successful game of its kind.
