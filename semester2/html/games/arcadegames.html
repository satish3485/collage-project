						Essentially, an arcade game (figure at the right)
						is a <b>machine</b> that runs games only if <b>coins</b> are inserted 
						in it. These machines are often called <b>coin-op</b> because they 
						are <b>coin-operated</b>.
						Arcade games were not created for domestic use (exceptions 
						are possible), indeed they were placed in <b>public places</b>, bars and also restaurants. <br>
						There are many kinds of arcade games but the most important are 
						video games, merchandisers, redemption games and pinball machines.
						In this page, we will treat mainly of <b>arcade video games</b>.
					</p>
				<h2>Origins of arcade video games</h2>

					<p>
						Inspired by <i>Spacewar</i><a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>, one of the earliest digital 
						computer games, in <b>1971</b> some students of the Stanford University 
						created the <i>Galaxy Game</i>, the earliest known coin-operated 
						video game. <br>
						A few months later, another important arcade video game was introduced:
						<i>Computer Space</i>. The game was created by <a href="videogame_programmer.html">
						Nolan Bushnell</a> and it was the world's first <b>commercially sold</b> 
						coin-operated video game. <br>
						<a href="videogame_programmer.html">Nolan Bushnell</a>, in collaboration with Ted Dabney,
						founded in <b>1972</b> the <a href="atari.html"><b>Atari</b></a> corporation. 
						This company was important for the history of arcade video games
						because it gave birth to the <b>coin-operated video game industry
						</b> with an electronic ping pong video game: 
						<a href="pong.html"><i>Pong</i></a>. <br>
						All these creations really marked the beginning of a new era:
						the <b>era of arcade video games</b>. From late 1970s until mid-1985 arcade
						video games growed in popularity and, for this reason, this period 
						is known as the <a href="arcade_golden_age.html">golden age of arcade video games</a>. <br>
						Nowadays arcade video games have lost a lot of popularity because 
						people can play video games comfortably and for "free" at home.
					</p>
				<h2>Arcade Genre</h2>
					<p>	The word "arcade" has assumed a new meaning in our days, indeed
					 	when we talk about "arcade" we usually refer to a <b>genre of video 
					 	games</b> for not coin-operated entertainment machines (PCs and consoles).<br>
						Video games of PCs and consoles can be gathered under the genre of
						"arcade games" if they share the features that are peculiar of arcade games:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Short</b> levels</li>
							<li><b>Fast increase</b> of difficulty</li>
							<li><b>Intuitive</b> control settings</li>
							<li><b>Hand-eye coordination</b> skill required to play</li>
						</ul>
					<p>
						Arcade games (we are referring to machines now) have these qualities
						because the player can play these games for a <b>limited amount of time</b>.
						Since the duration of time is determined by <b>avatar's life</b> and 
						<b>coins</b>, the game must be <b>easy to learn</b> and <b>short</b>.
					</p>
				<h2><i>Galaxy Game</i></h2>
					<p>
						<i>Galaxy Game</i> is practically the <b>reprogrammed version</b> of <i>Spacewar</i> 
						(a video game released in 1962) and it was the earliest coin-operated
						video game. The game was created in the University of Stanford in September 1971. 
						<br>
					 	In the beginning, only one unit of the game was built, but after a while 
					 	programmers decided to include more consoles in order to allow users
					 	to <b>play against each other</b>. <br>
					 	In the game, the player has the control of a <b>starship</b> and, with it, he
					 	must destroy the starship of the other player. In the center
					 	of the screen there is a <b>star</b> that pulls on starships and needs  
					 	manoeuvres to avoid falling into it.
					 </p>
				<h2><i>Computer Space</i></h2>
					<p>
						As we said before, this game was programmed by 
						Nolan Bushnell and it was released by <b>Nutting Associates</b><a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> in 1971. 
						<i>Computer Space</i> is known as the first coin-operated video game
						(and also first video game) to be traded and <b>widely-available</b>. <br>
						The gameplay is a bit different from the one of the <i>Galaxy Game</i>:
						the player, which has control of a <b>rocket ship</b> that is commanded by
						a thruster and a couple of rotational buttons, must avoid enemy fire 
						from a pair of <b>UFOs</b> (unidentified flying object). The ship is equipped with 
						missiles, so the player can fire back and destroy the ships of the
						enemies. <br>
						The player has the possibility to <b>increase play time</b> by beating
						the score of the saucers. If he is able to get a <b>higher score</b> at 
						the end of 90 seconds, he will automatically <b>gain another 90 seconds</b>.
