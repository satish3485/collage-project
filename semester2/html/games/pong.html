				<h1>PONG</h1>
                <img class="left" src="images/pong.png" style="width:110px;" alt="Pong">
<p><b>Pong</b>, built by <a href="atari.html">Atari Inc.</a>, was one of the first commercialised videogame ever and one of the first to reach mainstream popularity.</p>
<p>The game is <b>extremely simple</b>: the screen shows only one ball (actually a square) and two luminescent fingers, either controlled by one player and the computer, or two players simultaneously. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score.</p>
<h2>Importance of Pong</h2>
<p>Pong is considered one of the most <b>historically significant</b> titles because it is considered the game that launched the video game industry and started the "<a href="arcade_golden_age.html">arcade golden age</a>".
<h2>The origin of Pong</h2>
<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 120px;"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/pong_coinop.jpg" alt="Pong"><div class="caption">Pong</div></div>
<p>The concept of the game was invented in 1971 by Nolan Bushnell, the Atari founder, when he saw on the Magnavox Odyssey table tennis game. At that point, Bushnell decided to give to Atari's young engineer <b>Allan Alcorn</b> an exercise to replicate it: Pong was born.</p>

<p>Alcorn developed the game in three months creating from scratch the circuits: Pong worked through basic circuits such as AND, OR, etc.<br>
In 1972, once he finished the game he created a coin-op prototype that convinced Bushnell so much that they decided to sell it and, given the success, in 1975 was developed a home version that was an instant commercial success.</p>
