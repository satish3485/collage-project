				<h1>Arcade Golden Age</h1>
                <p><b>The golden age of arcade video games</b> is defined as the <b>peak era</b> of arcade video games <b>popularity</b> and it's usually positioned between <b>late 70s</b> and <b>mid-80s</b>. By this time graphics, although already of good-quality, were still <b>pretty basic</b> and not able to play a key role in a success game. Instead, the developers had to rely on simple and funny gameplay.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
				<h2>Games</h2>
                <p><b><a href="arcadegames.html">Arcade games</a></b> are coin-operated entertainment machines, usually installed in public spaces. An arcade game has to be simple, intuitive, with highly increasing level difficulty and the player is essentially <b>renting the game</b> for as long as their in-game avatar is still alive.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
                <h3>The first and most important Game</h3>
                <div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 10%;"><a href="#9"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/space_invaders.jpg" alt="Space Invaders"><div class="caption">Space Invaders</div></a></div>
                <p><i>Space invaders</i> were developed by <a href="videogame_programmer.html">Tomohiro Nishikado</a> and released in <b>1978</b>. It had two-dimensional fixed gameplay and the aim was  in defending the earth from aliens by shooting their space ships down. In fact, it was <b>one of the earliest <a href="shooters.html">shooting games</a></b>.</p>
                <br><p> Besides being one of the most famous arcades that firmly entered in the pop culture, it has been referenced and <b>parodied in multiple television shows</b>, and it has been part of several video game and cultural exhibitions. Later, this game was also the <b>inspiration</b> for other video games, re-released on numerous platforms and several sequels.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 25%;"><a href="#10"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/galaxian.jpg" alt="Galaxian"><div class="caption">Galaxian</div></a></div>
                <p><i>Galaxian</i> was designed by <a href="namco.html">Namco</a> and released in 1979 to compete with <i>Space Invaders</i>. It had a very similar design and gameplay, but in contrast to <i>Space Invaders</i>, <i>Galaxian</i> added an element of drama by having the aliens periodically make kamikaze-like dives at the player's ship. This made it the first game to feature <b>enemies with individual personalities</b>. 
                </p>
                <p>Galaxian introduced <b>RGB color graphics</b>. With multi-colored animated sprites and explosions, different colored fonts for the score and high score, the scrolling star field, and graphic icons that show the number of lives left and how many stages the player had completed.<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
                <div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 25%;"><a href="#11"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/kings_quest.png" alt="King's Quest"><div class="caption">King's Quest</div></a></div>
                <p><i>King's Quest</i> is a classic arcade video game series from golden age. Developed by <b>Sierra Entertainment</b> the first game was released in 1984, and the latest came in 1998. The main characters are members of the royal family of the Kingdom of Daventry and the game passes through their various trials and adventures. Many of the quests consist in solving some <b>item-based puzzles</b> making it similar to another genre: puzzle-games. The world of <i>King's Quest</i> encompasses many different kingdoms and supernatural realms. Technologically, the series pioneered the use of animation and pseudo-3D environments in graphic adventure games.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
                <p><i>Donkey Kong</i> was released by <a href="nintendo.html">Nintendo</a> in 1981. It was one of the first <b>platform games</b>, it consisted in the main character maneuvering while dodging moving objects as obstacles. Featuring 4 completely different levels the game was one of the most elaborated arcade of the time. It was very popular in North America: overall Nintendo earned 180 million dollars selling around 60000 <i>Donkey Kong</i> machines.<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
                <p>Released in 1980 by <a href="namco.html">Namco</a> <i>Pac-Man</i> is considered one of the <b>classics of the video game industry</b>. Very simple, it consisted in main character moving around eating dots and fruits without being catched by four enemies. Before it the most popular arcades were space shooter but this game succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
                <p>Another genre-defining game, or it's better to say a series of games, was <i>Street Fighter</i> which consisted in choosing one of many available characters and compete in a <b>martial arts tournament</b>. The first edition was released in 1987 by <a href="capcom.html">Capcom</a>. Each character has his own unique fighting style. The player can perform three types of punch and kick attacks, each varying in speed and strength, and three special attacks.<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
                <h2>Technologies</h2>
                <p>It was during this period that <b>RGB color graphics</b> became widespread, following the release of <i>Galaxian</i> in 1979. At around the same time, arcade video games began shifting away from single-screen titles towards <b>scrolling games</b>. The Golden Age also saw developers experimenting with <b>vector displays</b>, which produced crisp lines that couldn't be duplicated by raster displays. However, vector technology fell out of favor with arcade game companies due to the high costs. Several developers were also experimenting with so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D">pseudo-3D</a>. This period also saw significant advances in <b>digital audio technology</b>, for example <i>Space Invaders</i> in 1978 was the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
