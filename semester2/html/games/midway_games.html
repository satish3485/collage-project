				<h2>The Fall</h2>

<<<<<<< HEAD
				Despite the leadership in the '70s and '80s, Midway never really entered successfully the home console market neither as a <b>console manufacturer</b>
				nor as a <b>video game producer</b>, so with the fall of the arcade games' popularity in the '90s and 2000s Midway started to suffer heavy financial
				losses until they failed for <b>bankruptcy</b> in 2009, selling all their assets after a decade of struggles.
