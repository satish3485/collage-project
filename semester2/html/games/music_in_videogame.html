				<h1>Music in videogames</h1>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
                <div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 200px">
                	<a href="#11"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/synthesiser.jpg" alt="img"></a>
                	<div class="caption">A synthesiser from 70's</div></div>
                    
				<p>It is the <b>soundtrack</b> or <b>background music</b> that accompanies a video game.</p>
				
                <p>In 1975, the first soundtracks were made with the use of the <b>synthesiser technology</b>; along with time, video games started to include also more complex kind of music, even full orchestral pieces.</p>
                
                <p>The music in video games changes, according to the different situations in which the player is involved: the fight against enemies or the different places in which the protagonist of the game is.</p>
                
                
                <h2>1970: The first decade</h2>
                <p>In the late 70s, along with the <a href="arcade_golden_age.html">golden age of arcade video games</a>, music was stored on <b>physical medium in analog waveforms</b> (<a href="../hardware/portable_storage_devices.html">compact cassettes</a> and phonograph records). Altough, the use of music was not so common because this means were very expensive and likely to be broken. </p>
                
                	<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 200px">
                	<a href="#1"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/gun_fight.png" alt="img"></a>
                	<div class="caption">Gun Fight</div></div>
                	<p>The use of <strong>digital means</strong> was a breakthrough: electrical impulses changed the computer-code into analog-sound-waves to be used as output on a speaker. One of the first use of this technique was the opening chiptune in Tomohiro Nishikado's <strong><em>Gun Fight </em></strong><a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> (1975).</p>
                	<p>This allowed only <strong>monophonic</strong>, <strong>looped</strong> and short sounds as, for example, <strong><em>Pole Position</em></strong> or <strong><em>Pac-Man</em></strong><a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a> by <a href="namco.html">Namco</a>.
                  On the contrary, in <strong><em>Space Invaders </em></strong><a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> by <a href="taito_corporation.html">Taito</a> a continuous background was used (there were four chromatic descending bass notes repeated in loop), the first melodic soundtrack is instead found in <strong><em>Rally X</em></strong> by Namco.
                  The development in the field of music was so slow. Not every game programmer, in fact,  had skills in music so the sound capabilities (also for home consoles) were limited. The famous <a href="atari.html">Atari 2600</a>, for example, only supported two tones at a time.</p>
                  
                <h2>1980: The decisive breakthrough </h2>
              <p>During the 80s the game developers were getting used to this kind of technology. They began to improve their skills in this field trying different approaches: in <strong><em>Dig Dug </em></strong><a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a> by <a href="namco.html">Namco</a>, for example, the music stops only when the protagonist is not moving, and <a href="konami.html">Konami</a> used <strong>eleven different tracks</strong> for their <strong><em>Frogger</em></strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Home systems</strong> also saw a great upgrade in sound ability. The <a href="../hardware/commodore_64.html">Commodore 64</a> in 1982 was capable of <strong>early forms of filtering effects.</strong> The <a href="nintendo.html">Nintendo</a> with their <strong>Nintendo Entertainment System</strong> (NES) in 1985, was capable of reproducing <strong>five different sound channels</strong>.
                  Nintendo emerged also thanks to its collaboration with Koji Kondo<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> that created the soundtracks for both <strong><em>Super Mario Bros.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a></em></strong> and <strong><em>The Legend Of Zelda <a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a></em></strong> and with Hirokazu Tanaka<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a> for <strong><em>Metroid <a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a></em></strong> and <strong><em>Kid Icarus</em></strong>.</p>
                <div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 200px">
                	<a href="#12"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/imuse.jpg" alt="img"></a>
           	  <div class="caption">iMuse technology</div></div>
                
                <p>At the end of 1980 video game music were so popular that became to be sold as cassette tape soundtracks in Japan. Other companies from America started to give more attention to sounds in games.</p>
                
                <p>Video game music became so popular in the 90s that <a href="lucas_arts.html">LucasArts</a> decided to build an engine dedicated to the musical aspects of games with his <b>iMUSE</b>. It was an interactive music system able to <b>synchronise music with the visual action game</b>, with <b>transitions from one music theme to another</b>.</p>
                
                <p>Nowadays we can listen to realistic sounds and music at high definition from whatever game system (PCâ€™s or consoles) we have in our houses.</p>
