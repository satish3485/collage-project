				<h1>Sensible Software</h1>
				
				<p>
				<b>Sensible Software</b> was a European software house active in the '80s and the '90s.
				</p>
				<h2>The start</h2>
				<p>
				<b>Jon Hare</b> and <b>Chris Yates</b> (the two founders) after a short and an unfortunate career
				in music<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> found employment with <b>LT Software</b>, another game development company, by creating
				two of the most impressive ZX Spectrum games <i>Twister</i> and <i>Sordov the sorcerer</i>.
				After nine months the pair separated from the company to find their own, Sensible Software.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>
				</p>
				<h2>The success</h2>
				<p>
				Using the skills acquired in the time at LT Software, the couple started to develop
				<i>Parallax</i> for the <a href="pc_gaming.html">Commodore 64</a>, which won them a deal with Ocean Publishing becoming
				Sensible's first success.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				Right after <i>Parallax</i>, the company started to develop another game, <i>Wizball</i> which became their
				first critically acclaimed success, indeed it was proclaimed <b>"Game of the decade"</b> by the computer gaming magazine
				<i>Zzap!64</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Following the success of <i>Wizball</i>, Sensible Software released the <i>Shoot-Em Up Construction Kit</i>
				(S.E.U.C.K.) which allowed users with no knowledge of game creation to create their own game.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1988 <b>Martin Galway</b>,  well known <a href="music_in_videogame.html">game music</a> composer, joined the company and, in the summer, 
				they released <i>Microprose Soccer</i>, which would be considered the finest sportâ€™s simulation to date. 
				In that year Sensible also released <i>International 3D Tennis</i>, which became one of their last Commodore 64
				games.
				</p>
				<h2>The peak</h2>
				<p>
				In 1990, Galway left the company, but this didn't stop Sensible from moving to the 16 bit consoles releasing
				<i>Mega Lo Mania</i>, <i>Sensible Soccer</i> and <i>Cannon Fodder</i> which became classics of that era. With the rise of the 16 bit
				home console market Sensible released seven number one hit games, winning numerous industry awards in the process.
				Sensible's games were ported to a wide range of platforms, including <b>MS-DOS</b>, the <b>Mega Drive</b> and <b>Super Nintendo</b>.
				</p>
				<h2>The decline</h2>
				<p>
				After this time, though, Sensible never managed to live up to their past games. <b>Controversial Thematics</b> and the <b>rise
				of 3D graphics</b> made them lost contracts and their inability to move to the new dimension spelled their end.
