				<h1>Mattel Electronics</h1>
                <p>Mattel Electronics was the electronics division of Mattel Inc. that developed only one video game console: the <b>Mattel Intellivision</b></p>
               	<h2>Intellivision</h2>

                <p>The <b>Intellivision</b> was an home video game console released in 1979 and was the main competitor of <a href="atari.html">Atari</a> 2600. Mattel had promised that the console could be expanded into a fully functional home computer with the Keyboard Component, however, the original component proved to be too costly to mass-produce and to avoid a complaint for fraud by the Federal Trade Commission they substituted it with the <b>Entertainment Computer System</b>. This was an upgrade that turned the Intellivision into a computer. <br>Mattel also introduced an innovative device, IntelliVoice, which allowed players to accompany certain games with a rudimentary speech.</p>
                <p> In 1983, with the <a href="videogame_crash.html">video game crash</a> the Mattel Inc. closed its videogame division. Only in 1991 some managers would buy the division and reopen it under the name of Intellivision inc.</p>
