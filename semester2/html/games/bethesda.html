                <p><b>Bethesda Softworks</b> is an American video game publisher based in Rockville, Maryland. It was founded in 1986 by <b>Christopher Weaver</b> in <b>Bethesda, Maryland</b>. The company has a long history of PC and console games, it has created e few <b>genre-defining</b> games and it is worldwide known as one of the major video games publisher and developer.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
				<h2>History</h2>
                <p>As already said, Bethesda Softworks was founded in 1986 by <b>Christopher S. Weaver</b> in the small town of <b>Bethesda, Maryland</b>. Company's president <b>Vlatko Andonov</b> recalls that originally it should have been called <q><b>Softworks</b></q>, but the name was already taken: <q>So, our founder, sitting at his kitchen table in Bethesda decided after laborious thought to add Bethesda to Softworks and there you have it!</q><a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
                <p>The company began its illustrious career with the <b>physics-based sports</b> games. The first was <i>Gridiron!</i>, a football simulator for <a href="../hardware/amiga1000_hw.html">Amiga</a> and <a href="atari.html">Atari ST</a> personal computers. Their work was so impressive that Bethesda asked Trip Hawkins, the President of rival <b>Electronic Arts</b>, to become an affiliate in designing a new series of football games, <i>John Madden Football</i>. While the success in such a venture was obvious, the company chose to take their on way in games developing.</p>
                <p>Their approach to the market consisted in partially concentrating their development on the genre of roleplaying games: <b>Ted Peterson</b>, a former Bethesda developer declared that they were working on what supposed to be an "action game with a little bit of role-playing on the side". In fact in 1994 <i>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</i> was released and became a cult hit to RPG fans.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
                <h2>Games</h2>
                <h3><i>Gridiron!</i></h3>
                <p>In 1986 Bethesda Software released their first game: <i>Gridiron!</i> It was a football simulator, ugly even for 1986's standards. The players were represented by 22 dots and the rest of graphics was not much more elaborated.</p>
                <div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 30%;"><a href="#10"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/gridiron.png" alt="Gridiron!"><div class="caption">Gridiron!</div></a></div>
                <p>The aim of the game was to appear real and to simulate <b>real life football physics</b>. The dots had, for the first time in sports gaming, <b>true physics</b>: it means that stronger players could break the tackles of smaller ones, and a running back breaking a tackle would "bounce" off his defender just like he would in real life.</p> 
                <p>This kind of simulation was never seen before at the time, and the idea was so innovative that Gridiron! easily became a success, winning a 1987 Family Computing Award.<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
                <h3><i>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</i></h3>
                <p><i>Wayne Gretzky Hockey</i> is another sport game, this time ice-hockey themed, published by Bethesda Softworks in 1988. In 1 January 1989, a version for <a href="../software/os/dos.html">DOS</a> system was released.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
                <h3><i>Terminator</i></h3>
                <p>A <b>series</b> of games developed for DOS between 1990 and 1995. It was the first <b>officially licensed game</b> based on the <i>Terminator</i> film series. This allowed Bethesda to sublicense the film's rights for the console versions. The game reproduce a real part of Los Angeles: roughly from Beverly Drive to Central Ave, and from Mulholland Drive to National Blvd. The streets and their layout are largely accurate and it also includes some landmarks, such as Dodger Stadium, Griffith Park, and the Silver Lake Reservoir.<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
                <h3><i>The Elder Scrolls: Arena</i></h3>
                <div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 30%;"><a href="#11"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/arena.jpg" alt="The Elder Scrolls: Arena"><div class="caption">The Elder Scrolls: Arena</div></a></div>
                <p>In 1994 Bethesda released the first game of the series that made it worldwide famous and redefined the genre of <b>role-playing video games</b>. Like its sequels the game is played from a <b>first-person perspective</b>. One of the peculiarities is a very large world: players may explore outside cities, into the wild, where they may find inns, farms, small towns, dungeons, and other places of interest. The terrain is randomly generated and several hundred towns, dungeons, and NPCs are available.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
                <p>The game's release was disastrous. Bethesda missed their <b>Christmas 1993</b> deadline and the misleading packaging  contributed to distributor distaste for the game, leading to an initial distribution of <b>only 3,000 units</b>. When the game was launched, it was initially very buggy, indeed it was very difficult if not impossible to complete the main quest in the original, non-patched version of the game. Bethesda released a number of patches to fix almost all the glitches, making the game finishable and more stable.<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
