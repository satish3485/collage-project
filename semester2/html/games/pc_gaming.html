				<h1>PC Gaming</h1>
				<h2>First Technologies</h2>
				<p>
				The first computer games were created at the start of 1960 on <b>mainframe computers</b>.
				These computers were usually housed in universities and, since only a handful of people could use them,
				it's hard to find any relevant information on them.
				Everything we know is that they were text based games and that the "player" could communicate
				with the computer via <b>typewriters</b> and, later on, <a href="../hardware/keyboards_hw.html">keyboards</a>.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
				Then, with the start of the 70s, computer games became a more wide-spread phenomenon.
				</p>
				<h2>PC Gaming VS Consoles</h2>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 30%"><a href="#4"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/commodore_64.jpg"  alt="picture of commodore 64"><div class="caption">Commodore 64</div></a></div>
				<p>
				Until the '80s pc games were just a nice add on to a platform used to work, consoles dominated 
				the gaming market with <a href="atari.html">Atari</a> on the lead. Then came the '80s and a lot of things happened: in 
				1981, <a href="../software/companies_people/microsoft.html">Microsoft</a> released MS-DOS wich became a popular gaming system; in 1982,
				commodore released his <a href="pc_gaming.html">Commodore 64</a>, which became the <b>best selling</b> PC in history, and the whole
				console gaming market <a href="videogame_crash.html">crashed in 1983</a> leaving his share of consumers to PCs.
				Many computer advertisements recited things on the line of: 'Why should I buy a video game system when I can buy a computer
				that will play games and do so much more?'<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				Computer market started to grow really fast and kept afloat many companies hurt by the crash
				of consoles. In 1985, <a href="nintendo.html">Nintendo</a> released the <b>NES</b> in North America, resurrecting the console 
				market and ending the monopoly of PCs. A different story happened in Europe where the PC market kept growing.  
				</p>
				<p>
				One of the major differences in PC markets were between <b>Japan</b> and <b>Europe</b>. To accomodate Japanese text,
				they had <b>higher resolution</b>, wich translated to better graphics and better sound (thanks to their superior sound boards).
				During the 16 bit era in Europe the <a href="../hardware/amiga1000_hw.html"><b>Commodore Amiga</b></a> and <b>Atari ST</b> dominated the market, while in Japan
				different devices were popular.
				</p>
				<h2>IBM's Dominance</h2>
				<p>
				By 1987 the computer gaming market had grown so quickly and wide that the former business company
				<a href="../hardware/ibmpcjr_pcat_hw.html">IBM</a> had become the most important producer of platforms for computer games.
				More than a third of the games sold in North America were for the <b>IBM PC</b>, even outselling those for
				the popular <a href="pc_gaming.html">Commodore 64</a>, since the use of <b>EGA</b> video cards ment that an inexpensive PC had better
				looking games than Commodore 64's. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1989, <b>VGA graphics</b> appeared, meaning that finally PC graphics could be better than the ones on the <b>Amiga</b>,
				even if held down by poor speakers quality, and the increasing adoption of the <a href="../hardware/keyboards_hw.html"><b>mouse</b></a> meant
				that developers could adopt more high quality interfaces in their games.
				</p>
				<p>
				The next jump in quality was with the introduction of <a href="music_in_videogame.html"><b>FM synthesis</b></a> sound and 24 bit color graphics.
				Even if <b>Yamaha</b> started making FM synth boards in the early '80s, it was until the start of the '90s that they didn't became wide
				spread in the European and American market. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>ID Software</b>
				published their <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> in 1992, the game that popularized the first person <a href="shooters.html">shooter genre</a> and the first of a long
				streak of successes for the company.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
