				<p>Capcom is one of the most famous Japanese software house in the world. </p>
				<p> This society was first a branch of <b>Sambi Co.</b> (1981), formed by the union between <b>I.R.M Corporation</b> (founded on May 30, 1979) and <b>Japan Capsule Computers Co., Ltd.</b>. They were working in the field of manufacturing and distributing electronic game machines.<br>
				  In 1983 <b>Capcom Co.</b> was established in order to take over the internal sales department. </p>
				<p>
               In 1989 Capcom Co. established its supremacy over Sambi Co. and the company took this name. <b>Capcom</b> derives from ‘<b>CAP</b>sule <b>COM</b>puters’. <br> This name was created to distinguish the arcade machines from the personal computers. <br>The idea of ‘Capsule’ derives from the idea of Capcom to link its game software to a “<b>capsule packed to the brim with gaming fun</b>”. The figure of the capsule is also associated with the idea of a shell that protects both the customer and the product from being <a href="video_game_cracker.html"> hacked or copied</a>.
               
              <h2>The most famous games</h2>
                <p>Capcom began producing <a href="arcadegames.html">coin-operated games</a>. The real first video game was <i>Vulgus</i>, published in 1984, then <i>1942</i> was published in 1985. 
Capcom decided to develop itself in the market of <a href="console_generations.html">home console video games</a>, too: the absolute masterpieces were <i>Street Fighter</i>, which started a series of fighting games, and <i>Mega Man</i>.

               <h3 class="subP"><i>Vulgus</i></h3>
               <a href="#2"><img class="right" src="images/vulgus.png" style="width:25%" alt="screen"></a>
                <p class="subP">It was released in 1984, it's a <b>vertically scrolling shooter video game</b>. The name derives from Latin and it means ‘common people’.<br>
The gameplay is very simple: there is a <b>spaceship</b> that has to destroy all the incoming enemies. The player has two weapons at his disposal: a primary weapon with infinite ammunition and a supply of bombs that are collectible during the game.<br>
The game is, in theory, <b>infinite</b>, but it becomes harder as the time passes and it will not stop until the player loses his three lives.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

				<h3 class="subP"><i>1942</i></h3>
                <a href="#2"><img class="right" src="images/1942.jpg" alt="screen" style="width:25%"></a>

The player has to go through enemy planes, avoiding their fire, performing a roll or “loop-the-loop".
