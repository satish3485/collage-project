				<h1>Handheld consoles</h1>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 20%"><a href="#14"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/Autorace.jpg" alt="image of auto race"><div class="caption">The Mattel Auto Race</div></a></div>
				<h2>Early years of handheld gaming</h2>
				<p>
				The first digital handheld console was produced in 1977 by <b>Mattel<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></b> and it was
				just a basic LED-based game called <i>Auto Race</i>, this game only required 512 bytes of
				memory and consisted of making a dash on the screen (representing a pilot) to go on a straight line
				four times. This game got forgotten quickly though, overshadowed by new handhelds and later Mattel titles.
				</p>
				<p>
				The second attempt of the industry in the handheld market was in 1979 by <b>Milton Bradley</b><a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>
				with the <b>Microvision</b><a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>, this was the first true handheld console since it was the first to have
				interchangeable cartridges<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> allowing multiple games o be played on the same device. Despite this 
				innovation the Microvision didn't last very long, his 16x16 pixel LCD screen made difficult
				producing games for it and the cartridges were really fragile making the console disappear from stores
				in 1981.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>
				</p>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 20%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/gameandwatch.png" alt="image of a Game and Watch"><a href="#4"><div class="caption">Game and Watch</div></a></div>
				<p>
				In 1980, even Nintendo<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> made a venture into the handheld market with the Game and Watch,
				these handhelds had a single or two games interchangeable with a button press and worked with an LCD screen. The name Game and Watch
				was due to the fact that every console had a watch and an alarm in addition to the game,
				Nintendo produced 59 of these games	and dismissed production only in 1991 with approximately <b>43 million</b> games sold.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1984, <b>Epoch</b><a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a> (a Japanese company) tried to emulate the cartridge idea of the Microvision<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
				with his <i>Epoch's Game Pocket Computer</i> but even if it had a 75x64 LCD screen the console
				was a commercial failure being released only in Japan for  short period and having only 5 games
				made for it.
				</p>
				<h2>The boom</h2>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 15%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/Gameboy.jpg" alt="image of the Game Boy"><a href="#6"><div class="caption">Game Boy</div></a></div>
				<p>
				Later in 1989, Nintendo<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> released the <b>Game Boy</b><a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a>, even if critics were skeptical
				given the bad screen quality compared to competitor products the long battery life, the many ports of famous games
				and the reasonable price made the Game Boy<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a> a success and
				Nintendo would go on making newer versions of the system for the next 20 years.
				</p>
				<p>
				With the success of the Game Boy<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a> many companies tried to jump in the handheld market included Atari<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a>,
				after an unfortunate attempt in 1978 the company released the Lynx<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a> in 1989. The Lynx was the first portable console
				to have a color LCD display and it could be rotated to accomodate left handed players but the high price, short battery
				life and lack of games made it a commercial failure.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1990 <b>NEC</b> released one of the most impressive handheld consoles with the <b>Turbo Express</b>, the console was
				actually a portable version of the Turbgraphx-16<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a> (a rival of the Sega<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a> Genesis and Super Nintendo<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>) and was 
				about the size of Game Boy but had a sharp active-matrix color display and could even be used ad a TV. Unfortunately
				this console didn't have much success given its very high price.
				</p>
				<div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width: 20%"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/gamegear.png" alt="image of the Game Gear"><a href="#7"><div class="caption">Game Gear</div></a></div>
				<p>
				In 1991 Sega<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a> released the Game Gear riding on the success of the Genesis,
				the console's library was mostly comprised of Master System ports and outsold it's competitors (the Turbo Express and 
				the Lynx) thanks to his relatively low price and to the license to run popular Sega games like Sonic the Hedgehog but 
				it never came even close to the Game Boy's success.
