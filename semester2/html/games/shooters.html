						A shooter is a category of the video game genre. It revolves around
						 the act of <b>shooting</b> something, most commonly a foe, in order 
						 to proceed through the game. In these shooting games the player gets 
						 his hands on a large array of <b>ranged weapons</b> that can vary from
						 recent weapons such as hand guns, to futuristic weapons like
						 laser rifles.</p> <p>These types of games tend to be more focused on the players 
						 <b>precision</b> and ability to <b>react</b> quickly. These games also touch an
						 important aspect that other genres don't, which is <b>ammunition</b>. 
						This makes it so that the player must be aware of his current ammunition
						 and reinforces the fact that the player needs to be precise with his shots
						 in order to avoid wasting any ammunition.

					<h2>The origin of shooters</h2>

						</div> 
						In February 1962, the game
						<i>Spacewar</i> had been produced at the <b>Massachussets Institute of Technology</b>. <b>Steve Russell</b> was the one 
						behind the code of this game as the designer and programmer of the first version of
						<i>Spacewar</i>. It was programmed on a computer known as the <b>PDP-1</b> and is
						 considered the first shooter game. In this <b>two player</b> game you played as
						 one of the two spaceships with the intend of shooting the other down while avoiding
						 colliding with a star and when one of the two spaceships exploded, the other won.
						 Each ship had a limited supply of <b>fuel</b> and <b>missiles</b> and some 
						 intricate features like hyperspace which would help the spaceship evade the other
						 one's missiles at the risk of a higher chance of your spaceship exploding. After 
						 it's release,this game gained in popularity and began being ported into other systems. Thus,
					     this is not only credited as the first widely available and influential
						 released computer game, but it is also what marked the beginning of the rise of video games.
					<h2>The evolution of shooters</h2>
					<p>
						After the big hit of <i>Spacewar</i>, a lot of new shooting games like <i>
						Computer Space</i> or <a href="taito_corporation.html"><i>Gun Fight</i></a> were released, the later being a western
						<b>human vs human</b> shooting game and was the first of its kind. Then, came the game
						that would mark the beginning of the <a href="arcade_golden_age.html"><b>Golden age of arcade video game</b></a>, <i>Space Invaders</i>. It was an <a href="arcadegames.html"><b>arcade</b></a> video game released in 1978 that became extremely 
						popular in Japan and in the U.S.A. In this game, you play as a laser canon with the goal of fending 
						off an <b>alien invasion</b>. the controls are simple, you can move left or right to hide behind 
						covers and you can shoot upwards, however the more aliens you destroy the faster they're going to 
						move, and if they manage to reach Earth you loose.</p> <p> After it's release a lot of new shooter games 
						began to surge one after the other like <i>Galaxian</i> (1979) or <i>Asteroids</i> and new features were 
						implemented in these shooting games like <b>side-scrolling</b> in <i>Defender</i> (1981) or 
						<b>multiple levels</b> in <i>Scramble</i> (1981). All of these new shooters needed to be grouped, 
						so sub-categories were created;
							<ul>
								<li><b>Shoot 'em up</b> like <i>Galaxian, Space Invaders</i>or <i>Xevious</i>.</li>
								<li><b>Light gun shooters</b> with the use of the <i>Zapper</i> to shoot ducks in
								 the game <i>Duck Hunt</i></li>
								<li><b>Stealth shooters</b> like <i>Metal Gear</i></li>
								<li><b>First-person shooters</b> like <i>Maze War</i> or <i>Spazism</i></li>
							</ul>
						The list goes on and on, but the point is that these shooting games became more and more popular, 
						and aren't confined in only one category, they have a huge variety of different themes, 
						weapons, gameplay but what they all have in common, is that the player uses mainly ranged weapons.

					<h2>Maze War</h2>

						</div>
						This game was released in 1974 and is considered to be one of the first <b>first-person</b> <a href="pc_gaming.html">computer</a> shooting
						game that inspired a new genre of shooting games. A first-person shooting game is basically game where 
						you play in first-person, this means that you see through the eyes of the character your playing as.
						This perspective tends to make games more <b>realistic</b>  also because they are in 3D and not in 2D like 
						most of the games in that era. In <i>Maze War</i> the player would be put inside of a maze where they could 
						wander around until they find another player (that looked like an eye) and shoot them to gain points. This game 
						could be either played in <b>singleplayer</b> or <b>multiplayer</b> and contained a map so that the player 
						would not get lost. Essentially this can be considered as the first <b>player versus player</b> first-person 
						shooter that inspired games that, thanks to it's concept, inspired new first-person shooters that were getting 
						more and more violent as the graphics got better.

					<h2>Wolfenstein 3D</h2>

						</div>
					<p>
						This first-person shooter game was was developed by <b>id Software</b> and published 
						in 1992 by <b>Apogee Software</b> as a PC game. Inspired by <i>Castle Wolfenstein</i>, this 
						game followed the same plot but had a lot more success receiving many good reviews and sold 
						a lot of copies.  
					</p>
					<p>
						The main plot is quite simple, you play as an American spy with Polish roots called 
						<b>William "B.J." Blazkowicz</b> with the intent to rid the world of the <b>Nazi</b> 
						regime. The story is however divided into three episodes each with their own sub-plot, 
						that each contain levels the player needs to clear in order to proceed. This game is a first-person shooter (or <b>FPS</b>) in which the player fights a variety 
						of enemies including nazis, with a multitude of different weapons but with scarce ammunition. 
						The player can either find ammunition in the levels or pick up guns from fallen enemies, 
						however he needs to watch out for his life bar because if it depletes, he looses not only one 
						of his lifes, but also all of his weapons except for a knife and a pistol. Killing enemies earns the 
						player <b>points</b> that can be transformed into one more life if he reaches 40000 points. The player had 
						then the possibility of choosing his playstyle to be either more of a <b>run and gun</b> or <b>stealthy</b>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Even though this game was well received by a big part of the gaming community, it got a lot of 
						complaints and was considered as a <b>controversial</b> game by some. The two aspects of this game 
						that were considered controversial were first of the Nazi references with not only having the player fight 
						Nazis in their base but also fighting <b>Hitler</b> as a boss. And since the <b>Second World War</b> was 
						still reminiscent to a lot of people, it was not well recieved. Also the fact that this game was much more 
						violent compared to other games at the time, displaying a lot of <b>blood</b> added fuel to the fire to those who complained about the presence of Nazis.

						</div>
					<p>
						This is why this game was <b>censored</b> in certain hardwares like the <a href="nintendo.html"><b>SNES</b></a> where all of the 
						Nazi references were removed, blood was replaced by sweat, Hitler wasn't the villain anymore or in 
						the game at all and in the German copies of the game, not only were the angry dogs replaced by mutant rats 
						but the blood wasn't red anymore, it was green. This wasn't the first case of censorship in a video 
						game however this was a very heavy censorship especially for the German version everything is edited so 
						that there not only no signs of Nazis but also no signs of violence towards humans.
