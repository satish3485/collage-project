				<h1>Videogame Programmers </h1>
				<p>During the 20 years between the 1970 and 1990 a whole new world was born with the creation of <i>Space War</i>, the first videogame in the history witch lead to the development of a new revolutionary aspect of informatics world. As this aspect was growing up also some people started to become leader of in this section.<br></p>
               
                <h2>Alan Miller</h2><a href="#1"><img src="images/miller.png" class="right" style="width:250px" alt="Alan Miller"/></a>
                <p>Alan Miller is one of the most important figure in the video game industry and moreover he was also one of the first game designer and programmer for the Atari 2006. In the February 1977 he was one of the few game designer of the Atari Inc and under this amazing company he developed title as <i>Surround</i>, <i>Hunt & Score</i>, <i>Hangman and Basketball</i> one of the first ROM (Read-only memory) games for the Atari computers.
At the end of the 1979, Miller after having some issues with his previous company, he decided, with David Crane, Larry Kaplan and Bob Whitehead to find one of the most important game design company of the 21th century, the so called Activision under which they developed some titles as  <i>Checkers</i>, <i>Tennis</i>, <i>Ice Hockey</i>, <i>Starmaster and Robot Tank</i>.
The thought about the future of Whitehead and Miller were not were not on the same wavelength and for this reason they decided to left Activision and together from the game publisher Accolade in 1984. Even if in a small period of time this company became synonymous of high qualities they developed only one game called Law of the West for the Commodore 64.</p>
                <h2>Alex Pajitnov</h2><a href="#2"><img src="images/alex.jpg" class="right" style="width:250px" alt="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov#mediaviewer/File:Alexey_Pajitnov_-_2575833305_(crop).jpg"/></a>
                <p>Alex Pajitnov was born in 1956 in Moscow and is one of the most quoted game designer and software engineer, but he is mostly known as the inventor of <i>Tetris</i> game while he was working for Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre.<br>Pajitnov decided also to design the sequel of Tetris entitled <i>Welltris</i>. Between the two games there is no meaningful difference except that the second is structured in a 3 dimensional way. Tetris was licensed and managed by ELORG, a soviet company which had been found with this purpose. Pajitnov, together with Vladimir Pokhilko, decided to move to United State in the 1991 and during the 1996 he founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers </p>

Whitehead meanwhile he was working for Atari company, as Alan Miller, developed games for the Atari 2006 and also the Atari 400/800 computers. After some times and after some issues between Whitehead and Atari, he and others (Alan Miller, David Crane and Larry Kaplan) decided to co-founded Activision, the first third-party video game developer. Working for Activision company he developed a custom VCS development system and an amazing "venetian blinds" animation technique, an algorithm that horizontally reused and vertically interlaced sprites several times while rendering each frame, to give the illusion that the system had more than the maximum number of sprites allowed by the hardware. Unfortunatly, he and Activisions weren't in accord about the project to the future and for this reason he decided to leave together with Alan Miller, with which founded the Accolade company.However, soon after having founded the company he decided to leave the videogame design world.  </p>

                <h2>Chris Crawford</h2><a href="#4"><img src="images/craw.jpg" class="right" style="width:250px" alt="Chris Crawford"/></a>
                <p>Chris Crawford was born 1950 in Texas and during his career, he has become a game programmer and write. During the 80s he started working on a game called Wizard for Atari company, but this project was abandoned and his attention fall on the new "Home Computer System", now referred to as the Atari 8-bit family. His big interest in this new computer family land him to make experiment about the computer's hardware assisted smooth scrolling and used it to produce a scrolling map display. Thanks to these tests he was able to develop <i>Eastern Front (1941)</i>,  which is considered one of the first war games on a microcomputer, and <i>Legionnaire</i>.
After the 1983 Crawford's name was well known and after the game crash of the 1983/1984 he went freelancer and started to design Balance of Power which sold 250,000 copies.</p>

During his career at Activision, his games started to gain a high reputation and he also won some awards. One of his best known works was titled <i>Pitfall!</i> and it won the video game of the year in 1982.
In 1986, Crane left Activision to co-found Absolute Entertainment with Garry Kitchen mainly because the previous company was looking at the video games not as creative products but more like commodities. During these years at Absolute Entertainment he developed another masterpiece called  <i>Amazing Tennis and A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia</i>.

In 1969 Bushnell and Ted Dabney formed Syzygy,an arcade game engineering company, with the purpose of producing a <i>Spacewar</i> clone under the name of <i>Computer Space</i>. They made an agreement with Nutting Associates, but unfortunately the game didn't sell well, and the two developers thought that it was a failure caused by the Nutting Associates company; for this reason they decided to make an agreement for the next project with a bigger and more qualified company.After the 1972 they decided to incorporate under the name of Atari and after this change the 2 friends had to split up. During the next years from a cooperation between Bushnell and Alarcon was born one of the earliest and most popular arcade video games: <i>Pong</i>.

Blank in fact, was frustrated by the computer's tiny vocabulary, and for this reason he decided to start working on his own game thought the MDL (the MIT Design Language). Blank and a handful of friends wrote the original version of Zork on a PDP-10 while he was attending medical school. As the free-to-play version started spreading also the his popularity grew up exponentially. After having got the degree from medical school in 1979 he and several friends started to work hard on the <i>Zork</i> Project developing a particular language specially made to develop this game.

Even if in a first time the Nintendo of America disapproved it because it was so different from the common maze and shooter games, it was a total success. This was the project that opened the mihamoto's way to the developing of  Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong 3 and probably the most famous games of all time: <i>Mario Bros</i> and his sequel<i> Super Mario Bros</i> (a rework of Donkey Kong) and The <i>legend of Zelda</i> and his sequel <i>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</i>.</p>
