				<h1>The videogame crash of 1983</h1>
				<p>The videogame crash of 1983 (in Japan is known as the <b><a href="atari.html">Atari</a></b> crash), is an event happened between the end of 1983 and the 
				beginning of 1984 that crippled the <b>North American</b> and <b>Canadian</b> videogame market.
				</p>
				<h2>Why did the crash happen?</h2>
				<img src="images/crash.png" class="right noShadow" style="width: 45%" alt="graph of crash"/>
				<p>
				Contrary to popular belief, the causes of the crash weren't limited to a really bad game,
				but they were a mix of poor decisions and greediness. <br>
				The videogame industry became really popular between 1978 and 1983 surpassing
				the profits of the American Movie and Music industry combined, in this time <a href="atari.html">Atari</a>
				was the dominant company with the <a href="console_generations.html">Atari 2600</a>
				making its position seemingly impossible to change with his
				more than <b>8 million</b> users.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				Here the problems started to arise, many new companies began to produce 
				home consoles to try to get a slice of <b>Atari</b>'s profits and competing with them
				made the prices drop. In the meantime, third-party developers (like <a href="activision.html">Activision</a>, founded
				by former Atari programmers)<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> started to make a lot of games, many of really poor
				quality, for the newly released consoles to try and make a profit out of 
				consoles manufacturers success since consoles had <b>no lock</b> for third-party titles.
				At that time, the <a href="pc_gaming.html">PCs</a> were starting to gain popularity too with their
				double business and gaming possibilities supported by <b>long-term memories</b> that allowed gamers
				to save their progress instead of starting from the beginning every time.
				</p>
				<p>
				To counteract this "forced" drop in prices Atari decided to make ports
				of famous <a href="arcadegames.html">arcade games</a> to try sell more 2600 and cartridges like
				they already did previously with <b>space invaders</b> and <b>missile command</b>.
				In 1982 an abysmal port of <a href="namco.html">pac-man</a> sold incredibly well shipping around <b>7 million</b> 
				copies despite it being rushed. But here is where the flaws in Atari's strategy 
				began to appear, despite selling that much the company still had <b>5 million</b>
				copies left over that were never sold, more than all the copies sold by <b>Activision</b>
				with <b>Pitfall</b>, the second best-selling game. The copies of pac-man made were also
				more than all the 2600 sold until then, since Atari thought that the game would've made
				at least 2 million people wanting to buy a console.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				After this apparent success Atari's business executives signed a deal with <b>Steven Spielberg</b>
				to make an <a href="movie_games.html"><b>ET</b></a> game. ET promised to be one of the biggest movies of the year, it was
				thought that a game based on it would sell really well, so Atari payed
				Spielberg <b>25 million</b> up front to get the rights of the movie. 
				All in all not a bad decision if the game was gonna repay itself,
				but to hit a Christmas deadline Atari forced the game to be completed in a
				little more than <b>5 weeks</b>. If that wasn't enough, even if pac-man was the only
				game to sell more than 5 million copies in the history of the company, the copies
				ordered	to be produced were more than <b>6 millions</b> believing that the name alone would've
				sold all of them if not more. <br>
			
				Needless to say this wasn't the case, maybe stung by the pac-man flop of the previous
				year, consumers waited to buy ET to check if the game was any good, and it wasn't. This resulted in almost
				nobody buying it and Atari was again in the same situation as with pac-man with more than 5 million copies
				sitting in the warehouse and condemning the game to become known as the <b>worst game in history</b>
				and the game that single-handedly destroyed the videogame market.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
				</p>
				<p>
				Atari was making horrible games and selling them full-price, in the meantime, third-party
				developers were also horrible games, but selling them cheaply so no one bought Atari's games
				anymore.
				</p>
				<p>
				And then there was the nail in the coffin, in 1982's earning statements Atari told shareholders
				that despite the bad year the company would've still grown by <b>10-15%</b>. Great if they hadn't already
				said that the expected grow was going to be around <b>50%</b>, and so everything fell apart.
				Atari's stocks fell in value, making Warner Communications lose millions and
				consoles and games sells tanked. Legend has that Atari,unable to sell all the millions of cartridges made,
				buried them in a landfill in New Mexico (legend partially confirmed by a 2013 documentary made by Xbox Entertainment).<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>
				In the end the company was <b>500 million dollars</b> in debt and the whole industry that just a year
				before was valued <b>11.8 billion dollars</b> lost <b>97%</b> of its value settling at <b>100 million</b>.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>
				</p>
				<h2> After the crash </h2>

				<p>
				Even if it's called "videogame crash", it was more of a console problem only.
				PCs and arcades didn't stop <b>growing</b> and kept afloat, many companies, but analysts were together
				in saying that it was over, investors and retailers should look elsewhere and that 
				gaming consoles were never a really good idea.
				</p>
				<p>
				They knew that in <b>Japan</b> a little company called <a href="nintendo.html">Nintendo</a>, after the success
				of the <b>Famicon</b> in their homeland, was thinking that maybe the cause of the crash wasn't
				the concept of a dedicated gaming system; maybe it was just what it was, a series of bad
				decisions and greediness. And so they tried to launch the Famicon in America too, but trying
				to avoid the same mistakes Atari made. 
				</p>
				<p>
				First of all they <b>locked their system down</b>, every game would've been either <b>produced</b> or 
				<b>approved</b> by Nintendo before being released and would've worked only if it had a special
				chip in it that only Nintendo could provide. This helped them financially too, since (unlike the previous consoles)
				a game would've needed to have the chip third-party developers had to pay a royalty fee to
				publish a game for their console. <a href="nintendo.html">Nintendo</a> also changed the name of the Famicon to <a href="console_generations.html"><b>NES</b></a>
				(Nintendo Entertainment System) and also his appearance, from colourful to a more industrial grey
				and cartridges were hid away instead of being on the outside to "trick" consumers.
				</p>
				<p>
				The rest, as they say, is history. Despite Wall Street's failure previsions, the NES
				saved the American Console market and became an icon proving that the consoles were
				never really dead and paved the way for future companies.
				</p>
				<p>
				In a way is thanks to the videogame crash of 1983 that the industry is so strong today.
