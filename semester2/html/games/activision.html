				<h1>Activision</h1>
				<p>With the birth of the gaming industry, some companies gained popularity over others. Meanwhile some others began to stand out for their characteristic. This is the case of <b>Activision</b>, one of the most popular video game publisher companies of the 21st century. </p>
              <h2>Birth of Activision</h2><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width:30%"><a href="#1"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/acti.jpg" alt="acti"/><div class="caption">Activision's building</div></a></div>
                <p>During the 80s, third-party developers (companies that develop only the game and not the system) did not exist: the creators of a game's system were also its developers. One of the most famous example was the <a href="atari.html">Atari</a> company, who only developed games for the Atari 2600.</p><p> Many game designers were annoyed by this fact, as they did not receive <b>any credit</b> for their works, <b>nor  financial rewards</b> for the number of games sold.</p>
                <p> Atari programmers <a href="videogame_programmer.html">David Crane</a>, Larry Kaplan, <a href="videogame_programmer.html">Alan Miller</a>, and Bob Whitehead decided that this had gone on for long enough, and met Atari's CEO, <b>Ray Kassar</b>, to try and change this policy. They wanted to get royalties and their names on game boxes. Unfortunately Kassar did not approve their request.</p>
                <p> This was the turning point: Crane, Miller, and Whitehead together left Atari and founded Activision in <b>October 1979</b>, including in their ambitius project the music industry executive <b>Jim Levy</b> and later also Kaplan.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Why was Actvision popular amongst programmers?</h2><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width:30%"><a href="#2"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/millsfriends.png" alt="millsfriend"/><div class="caption">Alan Miller, David Crane and Garry Kitchen</div></a></div>
               <p>First of all, creators of games were given the respect they deserved: in fact, the company <b>promoted</b> their own game designers and gave them <b>full credit</b> for their own creations.</p>
               <p> An interesting addition was the possibility for players to send a photo with their </b>high score</b> in order to receive an embroidered patch in return.
               </p>
               <p>Several important programmers were drawn to the Activision company due to its simple yet significant changes, allowing game designers to feel respected in their work environment.</p> <br>

                <h2>What happened after the first years?</h2><div class="imgLeftWithCaption" style="width:30%"><a href="#3"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/pitfall.png" alt="pitfall"/><div class="caption"><i>Pitfall</i></div></a></div>
               After having had some legal conflicts with Atari, Activision started developing their <b>own titles</b>. One of the most important of these was <i>Pitfall!</i> a video game for Atari 2006, whose seals were second only to <i>Pac Man</i>'s.</p>
               <p> Later on, Activision purchased the <a href="infocom.html">Infocom</a> industry pioneer of text adventure, but that was not a good idea, because after several years of losses, in 1989 Activision <b>shut down</b> the Infocom studios in Cambridge, Massachusetts and most of the programmers lost their jobs in Activision.</p>
               <p>
               Activision started getting involved in the development of other software during 1988 and as a result, changed its corporate name to Mediagenic, to have a name which would globally represent all its activities, even though they were still producing videogames for other companies.</p>
               <br>
                <h2>Why did they choose the name Activision?</h2><div class="imgRightWithCaption" style="width:30%"><a href="#4"><img class="captionedImg" src="images/logo.png" alt="logo"></a></div>
                <p>
               The name of the company does not have a particular meaning, as the founders mainly intended to ensure that the name of their new company appeared in the phone-book before Atari. </p>
